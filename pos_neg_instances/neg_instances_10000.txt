{'content': 'reputation ; whereas a strict compliance with that con- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'dition is quite compatible with an admission of false ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'metaphors, false description, and an utter neglect of all ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'truth of thought in general. It is certain, indeed, that ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'we can hardly now detect in a dead language all the ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'little deflections from the highest standard of writing, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'which must have been as apparent to the contemporary ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'critic as similar faults are to us in compositions of our ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'own times ; and he who should now pretend to point ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'out the barbarisms of Demosthenes or the provincial- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'isms of Livy, would probably display more presumption ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'than acuteness in the attempt. But the rules of logic ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'are unchanging and universal, and any violation of them ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'will be as obvious to the careful student in Latin or ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'Greek as they might be in English ; and it may well ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'be added, that unless the classics be read with such a ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': 'understood, they will be read to no rational or worthy ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'purpose at all. But it must be remembered that there ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'are two kinds of logic ; — the logic of syllogism, depend- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'ing on grammar ; and the logic of passion, depending ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'on a real unity or integrity in the image or thought in- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'tended to be conveyed. Many a metaphor may be ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'false by the one system, and true by the other ; for the ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'logic of passion, when it operates at all, overrules the ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'logic of grammar. A collision, also, between the two ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'is sometimes seen in instances where a worn out meta- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'phor — and which, therefore, in fact, has ceased to be a ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'metaphor — is involved in a j uxta-position grammatically ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'incongruous with a figure still considered and felt to be ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'ETYMOLOGY. I ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'metaphorical; — as in Shakspeare\'s " Take up arms ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'against a sea of troubles," — where the expression of ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'taking up arms is not intended to convey any figure, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'but the simple notion of resisting. There is more need ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'of adverting to the logic or reasonableness of passion in ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'dramatic writing than in any other, although Pindar, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'and all high lyric poets in general, also demand its fre- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'quent allowance. ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'It follows from the foregoing remarks, if ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'they are well founded, that it is of the utmost ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'importance in studying Greek, to search out the radical ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'word or words of every compound, and also the literal, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'and therefore primary, meaning of the roots themselves. ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': "Without this discipline, a boy's scholarship will be laid ", 'annotations': []}

{'content': 'prepared for his use in the workshop of his mind. No ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'regulations can be too peremptory in requiring proof ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'that this labour has been undergone. But it must ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'always be borne in mind, that the mere hunting out of ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': 'which, single or in composition, it has acquired a ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'modified, or a metaphorical, meaning, be clearly per- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'ceived. The knowledge of the direct meaning of the ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'ultimate root of every word — as far back as we can ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'with any probability go — is the firm foundation upon ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'which the philologist must build up his system. The ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'positive value of this knowledge, taken by itself, is ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'considerable in the acquisition of any language ; but it ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'is relatively of the greatest importance in the study of ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'those languages which are the most independent of ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'others, and consequently the more strictly self-evolved. ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'Hence it should be an object of greater care in Greek ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': '2. Homer, who came so long before the philosophers, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'the critics, and the authors of treatises de arte poetica, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'was, and still remains, the sublimest of poets, in the ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': 'faculty of memory ; and, no doubt, it was so ordained ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'specially by Providence, for in the time of Homer, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'and for a good while afterwards, common writing had ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'not yet been introduced. Men, who were at this epoch ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'bodies without reflection, were all feeling for peculiar- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'ities of character, all imagination to seize and magnify ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'them, all invention to refer them to the classes which ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'the imagination had created, and, lastly, all memory to ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'retain them. All these faculties appertain, indeed, to ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'the mind, but they draw their origin and vigour from ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'the body. Memory is synonymous in Latin with ima- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'gination ; Terence so uses memorabile ; comminisci is to ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': 'turn, and throws them into novel groups. Thus, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'Memory has been called the mother of the Muses. ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': '9. Poets were, therefore, beyond a doubt, the first ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'historians of nations. Those who, since Plato and ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'Aristotle, have investigated the origin of poetry, might ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'have easily seen that all the histories of pagan nations ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'commence in fables. ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': 'two commendations which mean the same thing. ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': '13. The indecorums and quaintnesses with which ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'Homer may be reproached, were the natural result of ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'the poverty of the language then in use. Greek then ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'consisted entirely of images and comparisons; there ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'were no abstract terms by which the class and species ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'of things might be defined ; it was such diction as ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'necessity imposes upon entire nations. The heroic ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'verse itself was a product of the same necessity. ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': '14. In short, such fables, such a mode of thought, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'such manners, such diction and verse, were all equally ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': '3. In the Odyssey, when a person is praised for re- ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': 'separately from town to town, reciting the Homeric ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'poetry at festivals and fairs. ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': '4. According to etymology, the rhapsodes did no ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'more than arrange the poetry which they picked up ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'from amongst the people themselves. The word Homer ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'presents an analogous etymology, o^ov — afys/v, to bind ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'together. "O^pog is a surety, because the surety ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'binds the debtor and creditor together. This etymology, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'applied to Homer as hitherto conceived, is as forced, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'as it is easy and appropriate to my Homer, who bound ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'together and arranged the poetical fables. ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': '5. The Pisistratidse divided and disposed the poems ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'of Homer into the Iliad and Odyssey. By this we may ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'understand that these poems were, previously, nothing ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'but a confused mass of poetic legends. Besides which, ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': 'poems should be recited by the rhapsodes at the Pana- ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': '6. But the Pisistratidce were expelled from Athens, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'a short time before the Tarquins were banished from ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'Rome ; so that, in placing Homer in the time of Numa, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'the rhapsodes would have preserved these verses a long ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'time by memory. What helps to prove that Homer ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'was anterior to the use of writing is, that in no place ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'does he make any mention of alphabetical characters. ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'The letter of Proetus was by signs or symbols (^/xara). ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': '7. Aristarchus corrected the poems of Homer ; and ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'yet, without mentioning the crowd of licences in the ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'versification, we still find in the variety of his dialects ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'that discordant medley of heterogeneous expressions, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'which was, no doubt, the idioms of the different tribes ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'of Greece. ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': '8. Longinus, who could not deny the great diversity ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'of style in the two poems, imagines that Homer com- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'posed the Iliad while still young, and the Odyssey in ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'his old age. Certainly the resentment of Achilles ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'appears a subject more fitting for a young man, and ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'the adventures of Ulysses for an old one ; but how can ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'we predicate these particulars of the life of a man, of ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': '9. Tradition declares that Homer was blind, and that ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': '1. The uncertainty as to the country of Homer com- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'pels us to say, that if the people of Greece contended ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'amongst themselves for the honour of having given ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'birth to him, and all claimed him as citizen, it was be- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'cause they were themselves " Homer." If there was ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'such a diversity of opinion as to the time in which he ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': 'of the rhapsodes, who, being blind (whence their Ionian ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'name of owpoi), had the more powerful memory. These ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'rhapsodes were indigent persons, who gained their live- ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': 'part of the people which had embodied its history ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'therein. ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': '3, In this manner, Homer composed the Iliad in his ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'youth ; that is to say, in the infancy of Greece. She ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'was then all burning with sublime passions, with pride, ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'with resentment, and with revenge. These passions ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'are opposed to dissimulation, but do not exclude gener- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'osity. Greece, therefore, in her infancy, would admire ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'Achilles, the hero of force. Homer composed the ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'Odyssey in his old age, when the passions of the Greeks ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'began to be cooled by Reflection, the mother of Prudence. ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'Then Greece would naturally admire Ulysses, the hero ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': 'to take pleasure in the delights of Calypso, the volup- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'tuousness of Circe, the songs of the Sirens, and the ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'sports of the lovers of Penelope. In fact, how is it ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'possible to refer to the same age manners absolutely ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'opposed to each other ? This difficulty struck Plato so ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'forcibly, that, not knowing how otherwise to get rid of ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'it, he imagines that, in the transports of poetic enthu- ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'siasm, Homer was enabled to foresee these effeminate ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'and corrupt manners. But is not this to impute the ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'very highest imprudence to one whom he represents as ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'the author of the civilization of the Greeks ? To paint ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'such manners — even if he condemned them — was it not ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'to teach their imitation ? Let us rather admit that the ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'author of the Iliad must have long preceded that of the ', 'annotations': []}
{'content': 'Odyssey : that the first, a native of the north-east of ', 'annotations': []}

{'content': 'truth is, that all these imperfections, which have been ', 'annotations': []}
