The Homeric Poems are the oldest remains of Greek literature, but they were not the earliest poems of the Greeks. Lyric poetry naturally precedes epic poetry. Every nation has love songs, war songs, and dirges, before it has narrative poems. Those early songs of the Greeks are all lost, although traces of them are found in the Iliad and Odyssey, Doubtless the Greeks had also many brief songs, narrating exploits in war and hair-breadth \\'scapes in adventure, before any one thought of composing a long epic poem. In the Iliad and Odyssey are found indications of poems about the adventures of Heracles, of the Argonautic Expedition for the Golden Fleece, and of short songs about the expedition against Troy. The earlier and shorter epic poems were used freely by Homer (for this name may fairly be given to the man who formed the plan of the Iliad, and to whom its unity is due) in the composition of the Iliad, and again, after him, additions were made by other bards. The Iliad thus contains Pre-Homeric, Homeric, and PostHomeric elements. Some scholars lay more stress on the one class of elements, while other scholars lay more stress on another. But the lover of the poem, who reads it attentively again and again, generally feels the essential unity and harmony of the work more forcibly than the inconsistencies and discrepancies on which have been based the arguments for the different authorship of different parts of the poem. Composed at a time when the art of writing was not familiar to the people, when Greece had no * reading public,\\' the poem was made to be recited and heard, not to be read. It would, then, be composed in parts which could be recited at one sitting. The poet would not be solicitous to preserve exact harmony of detail between lays which were not likely to be sung in immediate succession nor on the same occasion. He would not begin his work with the plan of composing a poem of 15,000 verses, but, finding that his theme was popular and admitted of indefinite expansion, he would naturally develop what had been only indicated before. Thus the Books of the Iliad doubtless were not composed in the order in which they stand in our texts. The first part of the First Book must have been the earliest composed, for that is the basis of the rest of the poem; but Books II.-VI. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"9\" id=\"9\"/><p>vi INTRODUCTION. \\xc2\\xa7 2. </p><p>(and still more, Books VII.-X.) may have been composed after Book XI., in order to fill up the details of the story. </p><p>The beginner need not (and should not) be disturbed by questions as to the diverse authorship of different parts of the Iliad, The subject is exceedingly complicated, and cannot be studied profitably until the student is perfectly familiar with the entire poem, and with similar literature in other languages. The student should strive to enjoy and appreciate the Homeric Poems, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not to analyze them.* </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 2. a. Scholars now do not ask where Homer was bom, but rather where Greek epic poetry had its rise. The Muses were * Pierian Muses,* \\'OXvfiiria S^/mr \\xe2\\x82\\xacxoviT\\xe2\\x82\\xacU, and their earliest home seems to have been on the slopes of Mt. Olympus, in Pierian Thessaly. Thence epic poetry was carried by the Aeolians to Asia Minor, where it was adopted and perfected by the lonians. The Homeric Poems still contain many Aeolic forms in words and phrases for which the lonians had no metrical equivalent. </p><p>b. No one can tell the exact date of the composition of the Homeric Poems. Probably they were essentially in their present form as early as the Eighth Century b.c. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 3. a. An Epic Poem is a narration in heroic verse of a dignified story of considerable length which has a definite beginning, middle, and end, and an organic relation of parts. The time of the action should not be so long as to make difficult a general view of the story. The poet puts as much as possible of his tale into the mouth of his actors, and so the Iliad is strongly dramatic. In the First Book, the first 427 verses are almost entirely dramatic, the narrative serving simply as * stage directions.*  Epic poetry was the mother of the drama. </p><p>* The famous Homeric Question, as to the composition of the Homeric Poems, was first treated in a scientific way by a German scholar, Friedrich August Wolf, in his Prolegomena ad Homerum, 1795. He claimed that the Iliad and the Odyssey were not the work of one poet, and that the unity of each poem was given to it by scholars at the court of Pisistratus in Athens, in the Sixth Century B.C. He based his view on external arguments, which have grown weaker rather than stronger since his day, and are almost entirely neglected now. About half a century later, in 1837, another German scholar, Lachmann, divided the Iliad into sixteen different lays, resting his division on internal arguments, t.e., on the inconsistencies of different parts. The discussion now continues, with the use of internal arguments, but scholars are less inclined than a few years ago to suppose that the Iliad is a conglomeration of separate lays, a \\' fortuitous concurrence of atoms,\\' and are more disposed to favor the idea of a natural and organic development, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 such as was suggested for the Odyssey by Eircbhoff in 1859. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"10\" id=\"10\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa74b. EPIC POETRY. rii </p><p>b. The Homeric Poems used to be compared with Vergil\\'s Aeneid, Dante\\'s Divina Commedia^ and Milton\\'s Paradise Lost. But men have come to see a difference between the Natural Epic and the Literary Epic. Vergil had no personal (only an artistic) interest in the battles and adventures of his hero. He sends Aeneas to Hades simply because the Homeric Odysseus had been there; he makes Aeneas tell the story of his wanderings and sufferings to Queen Dido, because Odysseus had told a similar story to King Alcinous. Vergil consciously strives to unite the characteristics of both Iliad and Odyssey, and begins his poem with arma virumque cano, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the arma being for the Iliad and the virum for the Odyssey. Vergil is self-conscious, too, in the use of cano, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he remembers that he is the court poet of Augustus, and borrows the word * sing,* although his poem was not meant to be sung but to be read.   But Homer is in earnest when he says, aetSc tfca, Sing, goddess! </p><p>In the Epics of Vergil, Dante, and Milton, more grace and finish are expected, and more studied thought. * The capital distinction of Homeric poetry,\\' as Professor Jebb has well said, *is that it has all the freshness and simplicity of a primitive age, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all the charm which we associate with the \" childhood of the world \"; while on the other hand it has completely surmounted the rudeness of form, the struggle of thought with language, the tendency to grotesque or ignoble modes of speech, the incapacity for equable maintenance of a high level, which belong to the primitive stage of literature.\\' </p><p>c. A great Natural Epic is possible only in a nation which has a rich and varied mythology. Hence, the Romans, being without a mythology of their own, could have no great Natural Epic. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 4. a. Homer\\'s story of the Siege of Troy certainly was not intended as a history of an actual occurrence. The poet says again and again that he is of a later generation. He asks the Muse to tell the story, since she alone knows what really happened. Doubtless many such battles were fought and many such sieges endured in Asia Minor about 1000 years b.c. </p><p>b. Dr. Heinrich Schliemann was led by his Homeric enthusiasm, a few years ago, to excavate the site of Hissarlik (\\'Ilium Novum\\') in the Troad, near the Hellespont, and that of Mycenae in Argolis. In both places he found indications and remains of ancient wealth and power which justified the Homeric epithets of Ilios and Mycenae, and made more probable the belief that the story of the expedition against Troy was founded on fact. Mycenae may have been the chief city of Peloponnesus, at one time. An armada may have been led by the King of Mycenae against Troy. But certainly most of the incidents and names of heroes were invented. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"11\" id=\"11\"/><p>viii </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 5. a. HOMERIC LIFE. The Homeric Poems give a picture of life in Greece which differs in important particulars from that of the classical or historical period. The poet knows no one name for Greece as opposed to other lands. The Greeks are * Argives,* * Achaeans/ or * Danaans.\\' The * Hellenes\\' are as yet only the inhabitants of a small district in Thessaly. The names of \\' Attica\\' and\\' Peloponnesus\\' are unheard. Thebes seems to be in ruins. Athens has no special distinction. Menelaus, king of Sparta, and his country are comparatively insignificant, although the war was undertaken to avenge the wrong which he had suffered from Paris. The brother of Menelaus, Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, is the chief monarch of Greece. The Greek colonies and the Greek cities of Asia Minor are not mentioned. Monarchy prevails; democracies seem to be unknown. The king is also commander-in-chief of the army, judge, and priest. As head of the nation he represents it before the gods, but his power is practically limited. Public opinion is strong, although Homer has no word for law. </p><p>b. Monarchy prevails among the gods as among men. Zeus (* Jupiter\\') is mightier than all the rest together. Athena (\\'Minerva\\') and Apollo are next to Zeus in power. Athena is the chief divinity of war. Ares (* Mars\\') is comparatively insignificant. Dionysus (* Bacchus\\') is not as yet admitted to the circle of gods on Olympus. Asclepius (&lt; Aesculapius \\') is still a mortal. Pan and the Satyrs are unknown. The gift of prophecy is granted to individual men. The oracle of Delphi is hardly mentioned.   Temples are uncommon. </p><p>c. The Homeric knights do not ride on horseback, but fight from chariots. They roast their meat, and do not boil it. They sit at table, and do not recline at dinner. They buy their wives by large gifts of cattle to the parents. The most useful metal is copper or bronze; iron is little used. Coined money is unknown; all trade is barter. The occupations of the rich and poor differ little. Princes tend flocks and build houses; princesses fetch water and wash clothes. The heroes are their own butchers and cooks. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 6. THE STORY OF THE ILIAD, a. The action of the Iliad itself covers only a few days, but many allusions are made to preceding events which complete the story, </p><p>Paris (whose Greek name was Alexander), son of King Priam of Troy (or Bios) on the shore of the Hellespont, on the northwest comer of Asia Minor, carries away Helen, wife of King Menelaus of Sparta. The Achaeans (Greeks) unite to avenge the wrong, under command of Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, the brother of Menelaus. Nestor and Odysseus visit Thessaly and enlist Achilles (son of Peleus and the sea^goddess </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"12\" id=\"12\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa77 a. THE STORY OF THE ILIAD. ix </p><p>Xhetis) and his friend Patroclus. The Greeks assemble at Aulis. There a portent is seen, which the seer Calchas interprets to mean that they shall fight for nine years around Troy, and capture the city in the tenth year. On their way to Troy, they stop at the island of Lemnos, where they are hospitably entertained, and where they leave one of their chieftains, Philoctetes, who has been bitten by a water-snake. On their arrival at Troy, Menelaus and Odysseus go to the city as ambassadors, and demand the return of Helen, which is refused. Some of the Trojans even urge that the ambassadors be put to death, but their host Antenor and others secure their safety. The Achaeans begin the siege. The Trojans send to their neighbors and gain allies. </p><p>b. The siege is not very close. The Greek camp is at a considerable distance from the city, and the Greeks cannot devote all of their time to fighting. They are obliged to make expeditions against the neighboring towns in order to obtain supplies. In these marauding forays, the men of the sacked towns are killed or sent to other countries to be sold as slaves; the women are often brought to the Greek camp before Troy. Meanwhile, the wealth of the city of Troy is nearly exhausted. The Trojans have been obliged to pay and support their allies, and have been shut out from the use of their fields. Th^y are afraid to meet the Greeks in open battle. </p><p>c. Of the gods, Hera (* Juno\\'), Athena, and Poseidon (* Neptune *) favor the Achaeans; Aphrodite (* VenusAres, and Apollo favor the Trojans. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 7. a. The Iliad begins in the midst of the tenth year of the war. Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo, had been captured on one of the marauding expeditions of the Achaeans, and was given to Agamemnon as the * first-fruit\\' of the spoils. The captive\\'s aged father comes to the Greek camp, bearing the fillets of Apollo as his official insignia, and begs to be allowed to ransom his daughter, but Agamemnon sends him away, slighting his request. As he leaves the Greek camp, the old priest prays for vengeance to his god, Apollo, who hears his prayer and sends pestilence upon the Achaeans. For nine days the plague rages in the camp, but on the tenth day an assembly is called by Achilles, who urges that some seer be questioned of the cause of the god\\'s anger. The old seer Calchas tells the truth. Achilles reproaches Agamemnon, and the two heroes quarrel. At last Agamemnon sends Chryseis home to her father, but takes from Achilles his prize of honor, Brise\\'is. Achilles begs his mother, the sea-goddess Thetis, to invoke the aid of Zeus, praying that victory may be granted unto the Trojans until the Achaeans learn to value and honor her son\\'s might. This prayer is reluctantly granted by Zeuay and the First Book closes with a half-ludicrous scene on Olympus. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"13\" id=\"13\"/><p>X </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>b. At the opening of the Second Book, Zens sends to Agamemnon a delusive dream, bidding him to arm the Achaeans for battle, with all haste. After a council of the elders, Agamemnon tries the temper of the soldiers by proposing to return at once to their homes. To his grief, the men accede enthusiastically and begin immediately the preparations for the voyage. They are stopped by Odysseus, who acts imder the direction of Athena. A second assembly is held, the Greeks are shamed and awed into remaining, and they prepare for battle. As the Achaean army advances against Troy, the poet gives a muster of the forces, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the * Catalogue of the Ships,\\' \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which is followed by a less elaborate enumeration of the Trojans and their allies. </p><p>c. At the beginning of the Third Book, the opposing armies are about to meet, when Paris challenges Menelaus to a single combat which shall decide the war. The two husbands of Helen, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the wronged Menelaus and the offending Paris, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 are the fit champions of the two armies. This scene would naturally belong to the first year of the war; but as the poet begins his story in the tenth year of the war, the best that he can do is to make this combat the beginning of the conflicts which he describes. Priam is called from Troy, and a truce is struck. K Menelaus slays Paris, the Greeks are to take Helen and peaceably return to their homes. If Paris slays Menelaus, the Greeks are to withdraw at once. Menelaus disables Paris and has him in his power, when Aphrodite snatches up her Trojan favorite, and deposits him safely in his home. </p><p>d. The terms of the truce have not been fulfilled. Neither combatant has been slain, but the victory fairly belongs to the Greeks. In order that the Trojans may not surrender Helen, and preserve their city, Athena (who hates Troy) descends a third time to the field of war, and incites a Trojan ally to send an arrow at Menelaus. The Greek hero is wounded, and the Greeks, indignant at this treacherous breach of the truce, prepare at once for the battle, and advance upon the enemy, near the close of the Fourth Book. </p><p>e. Most of the Fifth Book is devoted to the brave deeds of Diomed, Bon of Tydeus. Hera, Athena, Aphrodite, and Ares take part in the battle, and the two latter divinities are woimded by Diomed. </p><p>f. In the Sixth Book, the Trojans are hard pressed, and Hector returns to the city in order to bid the matrons supplicate Athena\\'s mercy. He calls Paris to return to the field of battle, and takes a beautiful and pathetic farewell of his wife, Andromache. </p><p>g. The day which began at the opening of the Second Book ends near the close of the Seventh Book. The coming on of night puts a stop to a single combat between Hector and Telamonian Ajax.  The armies strike </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"14\" id=\"14\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa77o. </p><p>THE STORY OF THE ILIAD. </p><p>xi </p><p>a truce for one day, for the burial of the dead. The Greeks spend another day in building a wall about their camp, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a wall which was not needed as long as Achilles was fighting on their side, but which is necessary now that the Trojans are ready to assume the offensive, </p><p>h. The Eighth Book tells of a brief day of battle, in which the fortunes of war are continually changing, and in which Zeus continually interferes. At the close of this Book, the Achaeans are driven into their camp, and welcome the approach of night which affords them relief from pursuit and attack. The Trojans bivouac upon the plain and are confident of annihilating their enemies on the morrow. </p><p>i. On the night following the battle of the Eighth Book, the Greek leaders send to Achilles an embassy, offering him rich gifts, and begging him to return to the battle, but he stoutly refuses. The account of this embassy fills the Ninth Book. </p><p>j. The Tenth Book narrates the visit (on that same night) of Odysseus and Diomed to the Trojan camp, where they slay Rhesus, the Thracian leader, who had just arrived at the field of action. </p><p>k. With the Eleventh Book begins the third of the four days of battle of the Iliads \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a day which does not close until the end of the Eighteenth Book. Agamemnon distinguishes himself now more than on any other occasion, but retires from the field wounded, and is followed by Diomed and Odysseus who are also disabled. The Trojans press forward to the Greek wall, and at the close of the Twelfth Book, Hector breaks down the great gates, and opens a way for his comrades into the Greek camp. </p><p>1. At the opening of the Thirteenth Book, Poseidon comes from the sea in order to aid the Greeks. Hera distracts the attention of Zeus while Poseidon and the Achaeans put the Trojans to rout. </p><p>m. At the opening of the Fifteenth Book, Zeus notices what is done on the Trojan plain, and sends Poseidon back to his home in the sea. The Trojans press forward again and reach the Greek ships, and Hector calls for fire that he may burn the fleet. </p><p>n. At the opening of the Sixteenth Book, Patroclus begs Achilles to allow him to take the Myrmidons and enter the battle. Achilles sees the flicker of fire among the ships; he consents, and gives his friend his own armor to wear, but directs him to be satisfied with driving the enemy from the camp, and not to attempt the capture of Troy. Patroclus, however, becomes excited by the fray, and follows the Trojans to the very gate of the city.   There he is slain by Apollo and Hector. </p><p>o. Most of the Seventeenth Book is devoted to the battle around the body of Patroclus.  Hector strips off the armor, but the Achaeans with </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"15\" id=\"15\"/><p>xii </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa77 p. </p><p>great difficulty secure the corpse and carry it back to the camp, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 hard pressed by the enemy. </p><p>p. In the Eighteenth Book, Achilles learns with overwhelming grief of the death of his comrade. His mother Thetis comes from the sea to comfort him. His armor is in the hands of Hector, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 stripped from the body of Fatroclus. He cannot enter the combat, but he appears unarmed at the trench, and frightens away the Trojans. His mother goes to Olympus to beg for him beautiful armor from Hephaestus (\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Vulcan *). Here ends the third day of battle, which began with the opening of the Eleventh Book. </p><p>q. In the Nineteenth Book, Achilles is reconciled to Agamemnon. His hatred for Hector and his desire for vengeance on the slayer of Fatroclus more than overbalance his more ancient grudge. The fourth day of the battles of the Iliad begins. The gods descend to take part in the battle, but do not affect its issue. </p><p>r. On the opening of the Twenty-second Book, all the Trojans but Hector are either slain or within the walls of the city. But Hector does not yield to the entreaties of his father and mother, who, from the wall, pray him to return. He awaits Achilles and is slain. His body is dragged to the camp, after the chariot of Achilles. </p><p>s. The Twenty-third Book is devoted to the burial of Fatroclus, and the funeral games in his honor. </p><p>t. In the Twenty-fourth Book, the aged Friam, under the care of the gods, goes to the Achaean camp and obtains from Achilles the body of his son Hector. The * iracundus, inexorabilis\\' Achilles appears in a gentler mood. The corpse is brought back to Troy, and the poem closes with the funeral of Hector. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 8.

AFTER THE ILIAD. xiii </p><p>This scheme shows that the action of the lUad covers but seven weeks. Three of these are occupied by the action of the first book, and three by that of the last two books; only four days are spent in fighting. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 9. The Story after the Action of the Iliad. For part of the last act in the siege of Troy, indications exist in the Iliad and Odyssey. Many other details were added by later poets. </p><p>a. After the death of Hector, the Amazons come to the help of the Trojans. Their queen is slain by Achilles. Memnon, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a cousin of Hector, \\xe2\\x80\\x94the beautiful son of Eos (Dawn) and Tithonus, comes with his Aethiopians. He slays Nestor\\'s son Antilochus, a dear friend of Achilles, but is then himself slain by the mighty son of Thetis. Achilles is overcome by Apollo and Paris, as he is about to force an entrance to the city through the Scaean Gate. His mother comes from the sea, with her sister Nereids, and bewails him. She offers his beautiful armor as a prize to the bravest of the Greeks, and it is awarded to Odysseus. Telamonian Ajax goes mad in his disappointment at not receiving the armor, and commits suicide. Paris is slain, and Helen becomes the wife of his brother Deiphobus. Philoctetes, the bearer of the bow of Heracles, is brought from Lemnos where he had been left (\\xc2\\xa7 6, B 721 ff.); and Neoptolemus, the young son of Achilles, is brought from the island of Scyrus. Odysseus enters the city of Troy as a spy, in the guise of a beggar. Athena suggests to Odysseus the building of the * wooden horse,\\' in which the bravest of the Achaeans are hidden, while the rest set fire to their camp and sail away. The Trojans drag the wooden horse within the city, and at night the Greeks return and Troy is sacked. </p><p>b. Agamemnon reaches home in safety, but is treacherously murdered by his wife and her paramour, Aegisthus. Menelaus is driven from his course by a storm. Most of his ships are wrecked on the coast of Crete. He himself, with Helen, is carried by the wind to Aegypt, and wanders for eight years before his return to his home at Sparta. </p><p>c. Nestor, Diomed, and Idomeneus reach home safely. Ajax, the son of O\\'ileus, is wrecked and drowned. </p><p>d. Odysseus is driven by the storm to the land of the Lotus Eaters, thence to the island of Polyphemus (i), thence to the island of Aeolus, to the land of the Laestrygonians (where eleven of his twelve ships are destroyed), and to the island of Circe where he and his companions remain during a year (#c). Then they go to Hades (X) to consult the old seer Teiresias. On their return they pass Scylla and Charybdis, they come to the island of the Sun, and (urged by hunger) kill one of his cows. They are punished by shipwreck, from which Odysseus alone escapes. He is borne to the island of Calypso (/a), where he remains for eight years. Then </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"17\" id=\"17\"/><p>xiv INTRODUCTION. f la </p><p>he returns to his home on Ithaca, enduring many sufferings on the way. He finds his faithful wife, Penelope, surrounded by more than a hundred young and insolent suitors.   These he kills, and regains his kingdom. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 10. The division of the Iliad and Odyssey, each into twenty-four books, was not made by the poet himself, nor was it known in the classical period. It seems to have been made by the scholars of Alexandria about 250 years B.C. The \\'books\\' were lettered not numbered. The large letters of the Greek alphabet (A, B, F, jcrX.) are used to indicate the books of the Iliad; the small letters (a, ^, y, icr\\\\.) are used for the books of the Odyssey. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 11. HOMERIC STYLE, a. Matthew Arnold enumerates four essential characteristics of Homer\\'s poetry: * Homer is rapid in his movement, Homer is plain in his words and style, Homer is simple in his ideas, Homer is noble in his manner. Cowper renders him ill because he is slow in his movement and elaborate in his style; Pope renders him ill because he is artificial both in his style and in his words; Chapman renders him ill because he is fantastic in his ideas.\\' </p><p>If poets and masters have thus failed, clearly it is no easy achievement to translate Homer well, to be at the same time rapid, plain, simple, and noble, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 aS irtos ofm irdvra Swi/o-ctu avros cXccr^. The beginner can at least be simple; he should aim to attain the other qualities also. </p><p>b. Pope says in his preface: * That which in my opinion ought to be the endeavour of any one who translates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character. In particular places, where the sense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as most agreeing with that character. To copy him in all the variations of his style and the different modulations of his numbers. To preserve in the more active or more descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the more sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a fulness and perspicuity; in the sentences [sententiaej^, a shortness and gravity. Not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor sometimes the very cast of the periods. Neither to omit or confound any rites or customs of antiquity. ... To consider him attentively in comparison with Vergil above all the ancients, and with Milton above all the moderns.\\' </p><p>*The story of the Iliad is the Anger of Achilles, the most short and single subject that was ever chosen by any poet. Yet this he has supplied with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and episodes of all kinds than are to be found even in those poems, whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity. The action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole dursLtion occupies not so much as fifty </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"18\" id=\"18\"/><p>HOMERIC STYLE. </p><p>XV </p><p>days. Vergil, for want of so warm a genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer\\'s poems into one which is but a fourth part as large as his.\\' Pope, Translation of Homer, </p><p>c. Cowper says in his preface: \\' My chief boast is that I have adhered closely to the original, convinced that every departure from him would be punished with the forfeiture of some grace or beauty for which I could offer no substitute. ... It has been my point eveiywhere to be as little verbose as possible. ... In the affair of style, I have endeavoured neither to creep nor to bluster, for no author is so likely to betray his translator into both these faults as Homer, though himself never guilty of either. . . . The passages which will be least noticed . . . are those which have cost me abundantly the most labour. It is difficult to kill a sheep with dignity in a modern language, to flay and to prepare it for the table, detailing every circumstance of the process. Difficult also, without sinking below the level of poetry, to harness mules to a wagon, particularizing every article of their furniture, straps, rings, staples, and even the tying of the knots that kept all together. Homer, who writes always to the-eye, with all his sublimity and grandeur, has the minuteness of a Flemish painter.\\' Cowper, Translation of the Iliad. </p><p>d. Two passages from the great German critic, Lessing, are worthy to be remembered in this connection: \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The picture of the plague. What do we see on the canvas? Dead bodies, the flame of funeral pyres, the dying busied with the dead, the angry god upon a cloud discharging his arrows. The profuse wealth of the picture becomes poverty in the poet. ... Now let us turn to Homer himself [A 44-53]. The poet here is as far beyond the painter as life is better than a picture. Wrathful, with bow and quiver, Apollo descends from the Olympian towers. I not only see him, but hear him. At every step the arrows rattle on the shoulders of the angry god. He enters among the host like the night. Now he seats himself over against the ships, and with a terrible clang of the silver bow sends his first shaft against the mules and dogs. Next he turns his poisoned [deadly] darts upon the warriors themselves, and unceasing blaze on every side the corpse-laden pyres. It is impossible to translate into any other language the musical painting heard in the poet\\'s words.\\'  Laocoon xiii. (Miss Frothingham\\'s translation.) </p><p>* When Homer wishes to tell us how Agamemnon was dressed, [B 42 ff.] he makes the king put on every article of raiment in our presence: the soft tunic, the great mantle, the beautiful sandals, and the sword. When he is thus fully equipped he grasps his sceptre. We see the clothes while the poet is describing the act of dressing.  An inferior writer would have </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"19\" id=\"19\"/><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>f 11 e. </p><p>described the clothes down to the minutest fringe, and of the action we should have seen nothing. . . . How does he manage when he desires to give a more full and minute picture [B 101 ff.] of the sceptre, which is here called only ancestral and undecaying, as a similar one in another place is only ^vcrioi^ rjXoun ireirap/ievov^i Does he paint for us, beside the golden nails, the wood, and the carved head? He might have done so had he been writing a description for a book of heraldry, from which at some later day an exact copy was to be made. Yet I have no doubt that many a modem poet would have given such heraldic description in the honest belief that he was really making a picture himself, because he was giving the painter material for one. But what does Homer care how far he outstrips the painter? Instead of a copy, he gives us the history of the sceptre. First we see it in the workshop of Vulcan; then it shines in the hands of Jupiter; now it betokens the dignity of Mercury; now it is the baton of warlike Felops; and, again, the shepherd\\'s staff of peaceloving Atreus. . . . And so at last I know this sceptre better than if a painter should put it before my eyes, or a second Vulcan give it into my hands.\\'  Laocoon xvi. </p><p>e. Direct Discourse, Like the writers of Holy Scripture, and as in the simple style of ballads and fairy tales and the conversation of children and uneducated persons, the Homeric poet avoids the use of indirect discourse; he has no long passages in oratio obliqua, in the manner of the reported speeches in Caesar\\'s Commentaries. He passes quickly from indirect to direct discourse. Contrast 6 yap ^XOc &amp;oa^ ciri v^as \\'Axawov | . . icat XtaacTO Travra^ *A)(auns \\\\ \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 vfuv fiev Oeoi SoUv *OXv/x9r(a Btofwr ^Xovre^ I itcjrlpacLL Uptofwu} ttqAxv, cv K otKoS* Ikco^cu * | irat&amp;i ^ e/uuH XwroL T\\xe2\\x82\\xac &lt;f&gt;CKiijv TO. r airocva ^^adax, \\\\ d^ofjuevoi Ato5 vtdv, ktcqPoKov \\'AttoA.Xctfva A 12 ff. with its paraphrase which uses indirect discourse, iXBwv 6 Iep\\xe2\\x82\\xacV9 evx\\'^TO CKctW? fuv rovs Ocots Sovvol iXoyra^ rrp^ TpoCay avrovs autOrfvoL, r^v Sk Ovyaripa ot \\\\xxTca 8c{a/xei/ov9 airocva koL rov Bthv aJ&amp;fxrBhrra^ icrX. in Plato Rep. iii. 393 E. </p><p>f. Principal Clauses, Similar to this avoidance of indirect discourse is the poet\\'s frequent and ready transition from a subordinate to a principal clause, as 09 /xcya Travrcov | *ApyctW Kparia koJl 01 ircUBovTOL *A)((UOl A 78 f. who rules with might over all the Argives and him (for whom) the Achaeans obey, ^ enrt ttoXXo. fjLoyrjo\\'a, Soa-av    /xot vie? *AxoMav A 162. </p><p>g. Thus the poet deserts the participial for a finite construction, as lourCv T\\xe2\\x82\\xac TiTva-KOfievoL AaeorcTi t* l^aXXov T 80, where ri. . ri mark the imperfect as correlative with the participle. </p><p>h. Order of Words. The simplicity of the Homeric order of words is most clearly seen by comparing a passage of Homer, with a similar pas</p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"20\" id=\"20\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa7 11 m. </p><p>HOMERIC STYLE. </p><p>xvii </p><p>sage of a later Greek poet or of Vergil. Many verses of the Iliad and Odyssey can be translated into English, word for word as they stand, as &lt;axo/JL\\xe2\\x82\\xacff cs ^riP-qv Uprjv woXiv *HcTtWos, | Trjv Sk St^irpajSofiev re koI rjyofjLCV \\xe2\\x82\\xacv$aj8e Travra, | . . cic ^ IXxjv \\'ArpeiSv; Xpv(n/6Sa KoXXnrdpyov icr\\\\. A 366 ff. When the order differs essentially from the English, there are generally rhetorical or poetical reasons why the order is what it is. No one should suppose that the metre compelled the poet to adopt an arrangement of words that was not natm*al and did not please him. The verse gave prominence not merely to the first word but often to the word before the principal caesural pause (\\xc2\\xa7 58). </p><p>i. The thought of each Homeric verse is somewhat more independent than is the case in later poetry. Other things being equal, a word should be construed with words in the same rather than in another verse. Rarely does a descriptive adjective at the close of one verse agree directly with a noun at the beginning of the next. </p><p>j. A noun at the close of one verse often has an adjective apparently in agreement with it at the beginning of the next verse, but this adjective may be regarded as in apposition with the noun; it frequently serves to form a closer connection with a following amplifying clause, as fjojviv aciSc Oea . . I mikoixhrqv fivpC *A;(a\\xc2\\xab)is &amp;X.y\\xe2\\x82\\xac* iOyKcv A 1 f., where the relative clause explains ovXofjJvrp^: the torath was mortal, deadly^ because it brought ten thousand woes upon the Achaeans. So a few verses later, vovaroy ava arparov (ap&lt;r\\xe2\\x82\\xac Kam/v, 6\\\\\\xe2\\x82\\xackovto 8c Xoot A 10, the position of the adjective Kojcqv is explained by its connection with the thought of the following clause. Cf. vvv avri fuv vies \\'A;(aMov | cv iraXjaifirf^ f^topiovtri StKocrTroXoi oi rc Oifiurra^ | irpb^ A109 etpmrat A 237 ff., where SiKaxriroXjoi is explained by the following clause, avrov thus often contrasts a man with his companions or possessions, as diro fUv &lt;f&gt;0&lt;a tlpara Sixrco | avrov 3c KXmovra Ooajs CTTi v^as d^crco B 261 ff. </p><p>k. The subject of the sentence usually precedes its verb. Almost every exception to this remark is found either at the close of the verse, or (less frequently) before the principal caesura where the same metrical freedom was allowed as at the end of the verse, \\xc2\\xa7 59 a 3. </p><p>1. In order to give prominence to an important word, it is sometimes placed before the relative word of the clause to which it belongs, as i7a&lt;i)rcpo9 cos \\xc2\\xab\\xe2\\x82\\xac vetfu A 32. This is especially frequent when the subordinate clause precedes the principal sentence, as ^Eicrcop 8* m ^Koias rc irvAas . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 iKavcv, | d/i^* dpa /uv . . Oiov ktX. Z 237. </p><p>m. Adnoininal genitives, like adjectives, generally precede their noun, except at the close of the verse or before a caesural pause, but there are many exceptions to the rule in the case of adjectives, principally perhaps </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"21\" id=\"21\"/><p>xviii </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>f lln. </p><p>where the adjective and substantive are closely connected. A preposition often stands between the adjective and noun, as ^vaiw dm atcqirrpij^ A 15, 6oas CTTi vrja^ A 12, ^luript^ m oiic&lt;p A 30, vrja^ hn yAa^vpas F 119. </p><p>n. The infinitive generally follows the verb on which it depends. </p><p>o. When a noun is modified by two adjectives, it frequently is preceded by one and followed by the other, as irapa vrfi fieXoLVQ A 300. So in English poetry &lt; human face divine,\\' * purest ray serene,\\' * old man eloquent.\\' </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 12. Epithets, a. Ornamental epithets frequently have reference to the most marked natural characteristics of an object rather than to a particular occasion. The ships are swift (Ooai) even when they are drawn up on land (A 300 and passim). The heaven is starry even in broad daylight, Z 108. Homer calls milk Xcvicov, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 of course, not to distinguish white milk from milk of another color, but to bring the object vividly before the mind by mentioning a quality of it which all would recognize as belonging to the nature of the object. The choice among these stereotyped conventional epithets was often determined by the convenience oi metre or rhythm (see \\xc2\\xa7 22 Z\\xc2\\xbb f.). </p><p>b. Almost every prominent person in the poems has some special epithet or epithets. Pope calls these * a sort of supernumerary pictures of the persons or things they are joined to. We see the motion of Hector\\'s plumes in the epithet KopvOalokK.* No one but Athena is yXavKwri^ and the adjective becomes virtually a proper name. She bears this epithet 90 times, generally in the phrase Oca yXavKutm^ \\'A^ny. She is HaXXas \\'A^ny 41 times. The Achaeans are ivianqfuSes \\'Axaiot 36 times, Kaprj KOfiowvreq 29 times, in the genitive \\'Axotcov x&lt;\\'^\\'(oxira)vci&gt;v 24 times, vle9 \\'Axoutfv 64 times, Aoos *Ax&lt;uSiv 22 times, KovpoL *Axauav 9 times. Agamemnon is &amp;va( dvSptov 45 times in the Iliad and thrice in the Odyssey, while this title is given to only five other chiefs, once to each. Achilles is TToSapKYi^ Sioq \\'Ax^AXevs 21 times, woSa^ toKv^ *A;(iXXcvs 30 times, wo^kco^ AIolklSoo 10 times, iro&amp;uKca UrjktLnwa 10 times. Hector is KopvOatoXjK 37 times, &lt;^\\'iSi/Ao$\\'\\'Efcrcop 30 times.   C/*. pius Aeneas, fidus Achates. </p><p>c. The situation of the moment seems sometimes to contradict the epithet, as rov i&amp;ov ptyiyo-e ^o^v dyajOo^ Aio/iiySi/s E 596 at sight of him Diomed good at the war cry shuddered. </p><p>d.

The poet is fond of a cumulation of synonymous or nearly synonymous expressions, many of which remind the reader of redundant legal expressions, as &lt;^a&gt;n;ora9 irpooTfvSa A 201 lifted up his voice and addressed her, Ittos t c^mt Ik t ovofm^ev A 361 spoke a word and called upon him, ifiaj (oivros koi iirl xOovl BepKOfitvoio A 88, airptarrfv dvaTroivov A 99, rcov ov ri fUTarpeinj ovS* aXcyi^eiq A 160, </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"22\" id=\"22\"/><p>HOMERIC STYLB. </p><p>zix </p><p>iroXtfiJbi T\\xe2\\x82\\xac fidxajL re A177, iravraw fih Kparecw c^e\\\\ci irdvrtaat 8* dvaxraeiVy ] irSxn 8c ayf/mLV\\xe2\\x82\\xaciv A 288 f., ovr upofuu ovtc /leraXXSi A 553, o^ecu el k iOeXtfoda Kol a k\\xe2\\x82\\xaci/ tol ra fUfXT^ky A 353, \\xe2\\x80\\xa2^yyrope^ rjSk /xcSoktcs B 79. Sometimes the same stem is repeated for emphasis, in a different form, as oil/ifwv o^iriKeaTov B 325. </p><p>e. Epexegesis. A clause is often added epexegetically, to explain a preceding clause or word, as fx^viv . . ovXofjievrjv rj /ivpi* \\'A;(aiors SXye IOtjkcv a 1 f., rd T\\xe2\\x82\\xac Swp\\' *A&lt;^po&amp;Ti7s, | rj re KOfi-q to tc ciSos T 54 f. For explanatory asjmdeton, see \\xc2\\xa7 15 b. </p><p>f. The species often follows in apposition with the genus, as Kvfjuara fiOKpa BaXda-arj^ \\\\ irovrov *lKaploLo B 144 f., fimj^ \\\\ ravpoq B 480 f. Cf. the explanatory use of the infinitive, as epiSi ^werjKe yudx^odax A 8 brought together in strife, to contend. </p><p>g. Thus also the part of the mind or body which is employed or especially affected is mentioned, as ovk *Ayafi\\xe2\\x82\\xacfjjovL ijv&amp;ivc ^fjM A 24, X&lt;Do/i\\xc2\\xa3vo$ K^p A 44, KexpLpoiaTO Ovijm A 256, Iv 6&lt;l&gt;0aXfjjounv opSxrScu T 306. </p><p>h. Stereotyped Expressions, The same expressions recur under similar circumstances. We find a stereotyped description of a feast and of the preparations for it, of the breaking of day and of the approach of night, of doffing or donning sandals and armor; there are conventional expressions for setting out on a journey, for an attack in battle, for the fall and death of a warrior, for lying down to rest. Speeches are introduced and followed by set verses, as kcu /uv (or or^as) ^wnyaas iirea irrepoeyra irptxnju^ A 201, and in fifty other places; o cr^iv cv &lt;l&gt;poy\\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;ov dyofyrja-aro KCU /jicrcciTrev A 73 and in fourteen other places, while the second hemistich is found several times in other combinations; ^ rot o y &lt;Ss cittwv mr ap cfcTo, Totd-t S* dvcony A 68, 101, B 76. These stereotyped verses have been compared with the frequently recurring * And Job answered and said,\\' * Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,\\' of the book of Job, and with the set form in which the reports of the messengers were brought to the man of Uz, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 each of the four reports ending * and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.* </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 13. a. Parechesis, Onomatopoeia, etc. The poet seems to have looked with indifference on the similarity of sound in neighboring words. He does not appear to have designed the rhyme in iKiaOai, ^\\xe2\\x82\\xac\\\\\\xe2\\x82\\xac(t$cu A 19 f., SoKrct, dTroxrct A 96 f., ^(covaa, reKovora A 413 f., ipvaaav, rdwaa\\'av A 485 f., or between the two hemistichs of a verse, as Iottctc vvv fwi Movacu *0\\\\vpr TTia Sco/iar* cxovorot B 484. </p><p>Most exaniples of parechesis {iraprfxqo^si) and alliteration are probably accidental, as ttoXXcw Ik trokCmv B 131, h iroXjepav TrcoXi/o\\'ctu E 350, irarpL TC &lt;r&lt;f pAya injpa voXrji tc \\'jravri tc &amp;jpM V 50. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"23\" id=\"23\"/><p>XX </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa718 b. </p><p>b. Occasionally an onomatopoetic (oKopiroirotca), imitative expression is used, giving a kind of echo in the sound, as rpiyBa rc kcu rcrpaxOd r 363, of the breaking of the sword of Menelaus; cic 8c XpwrrfU 10709 ^rj irovTorjTopoio A 439, where a vivid imagination may perhaps hear the measured steps of the damsel as she leaves the ship, with a quick rush at the close; avri? hrtira ttcSovSc #cvXtv8ero XSm dvoi&amp;Js X 598, of the rolling back of the stone which Sisyphus in Hades was continually urging to the summit of a hill. </p><p>c. The poet plays occasionally on the names of his heroes, as TLpoOoo^ ^oos lyycfidvcvcv B 758 (\" swift by nature as well as by name \"), TXt/ttoXcyuov . . rkrjfiova Ovfwv Ix^^ ^^f^fop , . ttov artp Aacov trokiv \\xe2\\x82\\xac$\\xe2\\x82\\xacpjev E 472 f., whertf c^c/xcv seems to be selected with reference to the assumed etymology of ^EKTiop. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 14. a. Comparisons, A notable characteristic of Homeric style is the comparison. This is designed to throw into high relief some point in the action narrated; it often relieves the monotony of the description of a battle. But the poet is not always satisfied to illustrate the particular point for which the comparison is introduced; he often completes the picture by adding touches which have nothing to do with the narrative. </p><p>b. Illustrations are furnished by all experiences of life, from the lightning of Zeus and the conflict of opposing winds, from the snowstorm and the mountain torrent, to a child playing with the sand on the seashore, and a little girl clinging to her mother\\'s gown; from lions and eagles, to a stubborn ass which refuses to be driven from a cornfield by children, and to a greedy fly; from the evening star, to women wrangling in the street. The lion is a special favorite, and appears in comparisons thirty times in the Iliad. </p><p>c. Homer, like Milton, could not think of an army in motion without thinking of its resemblance to something else. Just before the Catalogue of the Ships, the movements of the Achaean armies are described by six detailed comparisons, B 455-483: the brightness of their armor is compared with the gleam of fire upon the mountains; their noisy tumult, with the clamor of cranes or swans on the Asian plain; in multitude, they are as the innumerable leaves and flowers of spring-time; they are impetuous and bold as the eager flies around the farm buildings; they are marshalled by their leaders as flocks of goats by their herds; their leader (Agamemnon) is like to Zeus, to Ares, to Poseidon, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he is preeminent among the heroes as a bull in a herd of cattle. </p><p>d. The Iliad has 182 detailed comparisons, 17 briefer (as Trcaalv Iolkorc9 riyopaaxrSt \\\\ Kiprtaxots 0I9 ov rt fie\\\\ct TroXe/uiiyta Ipya B 337 f.), and 28 </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"24\" id=\"24\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa716. </p><p>HOMERIC STYLE. </p><p>xxi </p><p>of the briefest sort. The Odyssey has 39 detailed comparisons, 6 briefer, and 13 very brief. The first book of the Iliad has only two comparisons, and those of the briefest, 6 S rju wktI cockcos A 47, -qvr ofux^V A 359. </p><p>e. Comparisons are introduced by q&gt;9 re, &lt;us ci,    ore, cSs irtp ktX. </p><p>Fraepositive W9 is not used in comparisons. In the briefest comparisons, postpositive m is often used, generally lengthening the preceding syllable (\\xc2\\xa7 59 j\\'). </p><p>f. The aorist indicative (the so-called &lt; gnomic aorist\\') is often used in comparisons. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 15. a. Asyndeton. In the Homeric period more frequently than in later Greek, sentences were left imconnected by conjunctions, i.e. asyndeton (H. 1039) was allowed more freely. Ornamental epithets are not connected by kcu, and sometimes in animated discourse the poet uses no conjunction between clauses or words, as dTrpian/v Avdiroivov A 99. </p><p>b. Asyndeton of sentences is most frequent where the second sentence explains the first and is in a kind of apposition with it, repeating the thought in a different form: oXAa koI m iB^hn So/uievtu ttoXiv ei rd y* aifieivcv\\' \\\\ PovXofi cyco Aaov aoov Ifjuitvax rj atrok\\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;rOai A 116 f., &amp; ttottoc, ^ /xeya ircvOo^ ^A^cuiSa yalav iKavei * | ^ kcv yyfdrj&amp;ax TLpCafjm TLpidfJuoio rc wat^q A 254 f., aXX avrjp c^eXei rrcpl travrtav ifijJievaJL oAAcov, | irdvTtav fjuev Kpariav c^cXci iravrccro-t S* dvocro-civ A 287 f. In B 299, tX^tc ^iAxm Kot fuivar hrl )(p6vov gives the sum of the preceding sentence, and the asyndeton marks the speaker\\'s warmth of feeling. </p><p>c. An adversative relation (biU) is occasionally expressed by an asyndeton, especially with ye fiev in the second clause, as B 703, E 516. </p><p>d. The absence of a conjunction often gives rapidity to the style and thus is found often where the second sentence begins with avrUa or at^a, as ei ^ aye /i^v iretfyrjaxu . . oT^d rot alfm KeXxavbv ipoyqa-a irepl Sovpi A 302 f., avTiKa KCprofuoun Ami Kpovicova trpoarfvSa A 539, cf. B 442. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 16. a. Chiasmus,^ For emphasis, the poet sometimes so arranges the words of two clauses that the extremes, as also the means, are cor</p><p>^ The name is given from the Greek letter X, there being a crossing of ideas as </p><p>ficuriKt^s &amp;ya665 KparepSs ^ alxfirrHis T 179. </p><p>It should be noticed that this chiastic arrangement is often the most simple and natural, as in the first example above, where &lt;roi at once suggests the other person interested, *o70os. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"25\" id=\"25\"/><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>i 16 b. </p><p>relative with or contrasted with each other, as mSd rc arot dycjficv* $oi)3a&gt; ff iepvpf ^Karofi^riy A 443, where muSa and hanofiPijy, aoC and ^P&lt;f respectively are contrasted.

Lost IV. 323 f. </p><p>b. Epanalepsis. Sometimes a word (generally a proper name) or a clause is repeated in the same sentence at the beginning of a new verse. Cf, Milton\\'s Lycidas 37 f. *But O the heavy change, now thou art gone, I Now thou art gone and never must retum.\\' The name is repeated at the beginning of three successive verses (Nt/9cvs . . Ntpcvs . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Ncpcvs) B 671 ff. Cf also B 838, 850, 871, Z 154. The name when repeated is attracted into the case of the following relative pronoun, in *AvSpo/iax&gt;7\\xc2\\xbb Ovyarrfp fLcyoXiyTO/jos \\'Hctouvos, | \\'HctiW emicv xnro TLXwaa vkrfiarfrg Z 395 f. Andromache, daughter of the greatsouled Eetion, Eetion who dwelt ai the foot of woody Placus. </p><p>c. Litotes (XiTOTTji or /ulwm), a simplicity of language, or understatement of the truth, is common to all languages. Milton\\'s \\' unblest feet\\' is stronger than cursed feet. Homeric examples abound, as ovk *Ayafi\\xe2\\x82\\xac/ivoyt \\xe2\\x80\\xa2^vSave $vfJM A 24: it was not pleasing to the soul of Agamemnon, i.e. it was hateful, etc.; &amp;^ cs kovXcov uktc /icya {t&lt;^$ ou8\\' aTriOrjaey \\\\ fivSta *AOrjvahfi A 220 f. hack into the sheath he thrust his great sword nor did he disobey the word of ^Athena, i.e. he obeyed; \\'\"EtKnap 8* ov ri OeSs liros yyvoirjaey B807. </p><p>d. a. Periphrasis. Certain periphrases occur frequently, as dfcrc 8^ TLpLaifiMo pCrjiv V 105 bring the might of Priam, i.e. the mighty Priam, Ha^Aaydva&gt;v 8* i/yetro HvAai/xei/cos Xoctlov K^p B 851, ij Ittci Svrja-as Kpahuqv Aios 17c icoi cpyo) A 395.

Cf. Shakspere Twelfth Night I. ii. * For I was bred and born | Not three hours\\' travel from this very place\\' and Vergil\\'s moriamur et in media arma ruamus, </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 17. Later Change in Words* The student must be watchful to apprehend the exact Homeric meaning of words which are used in a slightly different sense in later Greek. Thus dyopi] and ayiav ai*e used in Homer of an assemhly, gathering, not of market and contest, *Kl&amp;q^ is always the name of a person, not of a place. doi&amp;&gt;9, doi^, are used for the Attic iroitjfrq^y v/iyo^, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 cttos is, used for koyoq, icoa/A\\xe2\\x82\\xaco&gt; for Toxram. Scivos means terrible, not skilful, Selnvov is the principal meal of the day, whenever it is taken, lyxos means spear, never sword, ijptai is used of all the warriors; it does not mean a hero in the English sense. Kpcm is select, discriminate, rather than judge, vocco often has the sense of aiaOdyofuu (which is not Homeric), /)erc\\xc2\\xabrtf. ovofuu is not blame in a general way, but think not enough, insufficient, ouro^co is wound unth a weapon held in the hand, not with a missile, irifiino is escort, attend, as well as send; cf. iro/uwny convoy, -toXc/aos is often battle rather than war. TTfyqcraui is carry through rather than (fo as in Attic. (r^cSoi^ is near, of place, not almost, awfjixi is used only of a dead body, Sc/xas being used of the living form, and avros and irepl xpdt taking some of the Attic uses of aw/xa. Toxa always means quickly, never perhaps as in later Greek. rlBrffU is often used like iroUio make. fl&gt;6po^ is not fright but flight; ffioPeofmi is not fear but flee.  &lt;us does not mean since. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 18. HOMERIC SYNTAX, a. In syntax as in forms, where the Homeric dialect differs from the Attic, it may be presumed that the Homeric usage is the earlier. The language was less rigid; custom had not yet established certain constructions as normal. There was greater freedom in the use of the modes and the cases, of prepositions and conjunctions. </p><p>b. It is impossible to bring the Homeric uses of the modes under the categories and rules that prevailed in the Attic period. Intermediate in force between the simple future and the potential optative with dv were </p><p>(1) the subjunctive as a less vivid future, as ov yap iria rotovs ISw dyipaji ovSe t&amp;ofuu A 262 / never yet saw such men nor shall I see them. (H. 868; G. 1321.) </p><p>(2) the subjunctive with k\\xe2\\x82\\xacv or av, as a potential mode, as ct 8c firj SfMoatv, cyctf Sc kcv avros iXcofuu A 137 but if they shall not give it, I myself </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"27\" id=\"27\"/><p>xxiv </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa718c. </p><p>toill then take, etc. ovk dv roi XP^HV \\'^ti^op^s T 54 the cithara would not in that case avail thee. </p><p>c. The subjunctive is used more freely in Homer than in later Greek. </p><p>d. a. Homer prefers a with the subjunctive to c? kcv (a7 k\\xe2\\x82\\xacv) or ei S\\xc2\\xbb with the subjunctive,   ci ay is not used in general conditions. </p><p>p. a fccv is rarely used with the optative (29 times in all); never in the expression of a wish, ci av is used with the optative but once, ci ircp av avroi | fjuovam aeiSoccv B 597 f. </p><p>y. The optative in indirect discourse is used for the indicative in direct discourse only in questions. </p><p>S, In six passages the optative with Key is used in the apodosis, where Homeric and Attic usage alike lead us to expect av with a past tense of the indicative, as kcu vv k\\xe2\\x82\\xacv tvff aaroKwro dvai aa^pStv AlvtCa^y \\\\ ci firi Sp* 6$v vovjce Aios Ovydrrfp *A&lt;l&gt;poS{\\'nj E 311 f. \" Aeneas would have perished if Aphrodite had not perceived,\" etc. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 19. a. The cases retained more of their original force than in Attic and had less need of a preposition to make the construction distinct (it was once thought that the poet omitted the preposition for the convenience of his verse), as the ablatival genitive in cpicos *Axcuounv ?re\\\\cTai fToXc/ACMo KOKoio A 284 is a bulwark for the Achaeans from (to keep off) evil war, KapiraXCfim dvcSu rroXi^^ aXos rjvr opixKrj A 359 swiftly she rose as a mist out of the hoary sea. The dative of place is often found without a preposition, as roC &amp;pjounv \\xe2\\x82\\xacx\\xc2\\xab&gt;v A 45 having his how upon his shoulder. </p><p>b. The prepositions still retained much of their adverbial nature, and had not become fixedly attached to the verbs which they modified (\\xc2\\xa7 55). It was once thought that the occasional separation of verb and preposition was a poetic license, and (considered as a surgical operation) it was called tmesis. </p><p>c. In the Homeric period certain constructions were only beginning to appear definitely in use, such as the accusative with the infinitive, and the genitive absolute. </p><p>d. a. The genitive absolute is more frequent with the present parti* ciple than with the aorist participle. The genitive absolute with omitted Bubject is particularly rare, and is denied by most scholars. The participle sometimes seems to be used with omitted subject when it really agrees with the genitive implied in a preceding dative. </p><p>p. It is often impossible to say categorically whether the genitive is in the absolute construction or rather depends on some other word, as xnrb Sk Tpioes K\\xe2\\x82\\xac)(aSovTO \\\\ avSpos aKovrCaauvTo^ A 497 f., where the position of t^e genitive at the beginning of the verse gives it greater independence, but it was probably influenced by the verb, the Trojans drew </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"28\" id=\"28\"/><p>HOMERIC SYNTAX. </p><p>XXV </p><p>back from the man as he hurled his javelin ; cf. iicXay^av dp* ourroi iir wfifuv \\\\&lt;oofifvoio I avrov KivrjOevToq A 46 f. </p><p>y. Sometimes a preposition is used where the genitive absolute would be used in Attic prose, as afiffn 8c v^c? | (Tfitp^aXiov KovaiPrjauv dvcravrow inr *A)((ii(av B 333 f. </p><p>e. The dative of interest is often used with the verb where the English idiom prefers a possessive genitive with a noun, as heivm 8c ot 6&lt;r&lt;r\\xe2\\x82\\xac &lt;f&gt;a avOtv A 200 terribly did her (lit. for her the) eyes gleam; or is used instead of an ablatival genitive with a preposition, as Aavaouriv deiKca Xoiyov airilxr\\xe2\\x82\\xact A 97 will ward off ignominious destruction from (lit./or) the Danai; or instead of a genitive with verbs of ruling and leading, as iravrccro-i 8* dmo-creiv A 288 to reign over (lit. be the king for) all; or instead of an adverbial expression, as touti 8* dvc\\'oTTy A 68 for them rose (not to be taken as a local dative, among them). </p><p>f. tnro is used with the dative in almost the same sense as with the genitive in Attic, as i^firj wo X^P^^ woSwKeoq AioKtSao B 860 he was slain by the hands of the swift-footed Aeacides, with perhaps more of the original local force of the preposition. </p><p>g. Some constructions were used more freely and constantly than in later Greek. Certain of these were always looked upon as poetic, as OtCri irthiou} Z 507 shall run over the plain, Xav\\xe2\\x82\\xac.crOax worafwio Z 508. For the genitive of the place to which the action belongs, see H. 760; G. 1137. </p><p>h. A neuter noun in the plural is the subject of a plural verb more frequently than in Attic. The imperfect is more freely used in narrative, to describe an action as in progress. The historical present is not used. ccTTi is not always a mere copula, and is occasionally modified by an adverb, as a true verb of existence, of iireC vv roi dau /uvwOd irtp, ov Ti frnKoL Sijv A 416 since thy appointed time of life is brief etc., and fuwvOa 8c oi yeyeff opfi-q A 466 but brief was his onset. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 20. a. Particles, cu The beginner in reading Homer is perplexed by a large number of particles that are often difiicult to render by English words. Their force can often be best given by the order of the words in the translation or by the tone of voice in reading. To translate pd as was natural (or even you see) or yc at least, often throws upon the particle very disproportionate emphasis. The student can most easily and clearly appreciate the force of a particle by comparing a number of examples which have become familiar to him; he will then see the importance of these particles to the character and tone of a speech or of the narrative. </p><p>fi. ri is used far more freely than in Attic prose. A single tc is often used to connect single notions, as kwccto-iv | otcovoto-i tc A 4 f. </p><p>y. 6&lt;l&gt;pa is the usual particle to introduce a final clause. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"29\" id=\"29\"/><p>XX vi </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>f 20h. </p><p>b. Interrogative Particles, a. The general interrogative particle in Homer is ^, but in a doable question (where the Attic Greek uses wore* poy, rj OT stands in the first member, ^ or ^ in the second, cf* A 190 ff. </p><p>p. When ^ introduces a single question, it is rarely used as in Attic, as a mere interrogation point. It regularly implies emotion of some kind. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 21. a. Parataxis, The Homeric language is far less distinct than the Latin or the English in the expression of logical relations, and gives less prominence to the logical forms of syntax; but it is seldom difficult to appreciate the ancient idiom if an attempt is made to find the Homeric point of view. </p><p>The Homeric poems contain many survivals of the simplest form of sentences. In the earliest stage of the Greek language, clauses were not combined with each other as secondary and principal; they were simply added one to the other. To use the technical terms, coordination or parataxis (impoTaii^) was the rule, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not subordination or hypotaxis (wrora^is). Originally the relatives were demonstratives, and relative sentences have been called &lt; parenthetic demonstrative sentences.\\' Thus 8c was used in the apodosis of relative and conditional sentences. This was especially frequent when the relative or conditional clause preceded, as ci 3c ICC fi^ ScooKTiv, cyctf 8c Kcv avro9 ekiofuu A 137 but if they shall not give it, (but) I myself shall then take, etc, clos 6 ravff lopfjuuve . . ^XBe 8* *A&amp;rjvrj A 193 f. while he was pondering thu ... (but) Athena came, oirj irep fl&gt;vW&lt;av ycvci;, Toirj 8c kcu dv8pa&gt;v Z 146 as is the race of leaves, (but) such is also the race of men. So airdp and dAAa are used with stronger emphasis than 8c, as ci 8c (TV KOLprepos ccrori, Oea 8c ore ycLvaro prfrqp \\\\ dX\\\\* o8c ^iprr\\xe2\\x82\\xacp6i lariv lird TrXcdvccrcriv dvourcrci A 280 f. but if thou art mighty and a goddess is thy mother, but, etc, where the apodosis is really contrasted with the protasis, cf A 81 quoted in the next paragraph. </p><p>b. Compare with the foregoing the use of kol in the conclusion of relative sentences, to mark the connection of the clauses. Thus also rc was freely used in subordinate clauses, as os icc $\\xe2\\x82\\xacois hmruBrfrax pjoXa r* IkXvov avrov A 218 whoever obeys the gods, (and) himself the gods readily hear; and rc\\xe2\\x80\\x94tc is found in both protasis and apodosis, marking their correlation, as ci Trcp yap rc xokov . .

Correlative Constructions, The Greek language was always fond of a parallel or antithetic construction, a contrast, a balance, where the English subordinates one thought to the other; but the adversative relation, where the English idiom would use a subordinate clause introduced by for, although, when, while, or since, is more frequent in these poems than in later Greek, as oXAa wCOea-ff * afi^a&gt; Sk vtwipm iarov i/ielo A 259, &lt;l&gt;vXXa ra /xey r* avc/i09 x^fwJ^i^ xiei, aWa 8c ff vXrf \\\\ TrfXeOowra ^vo, eopos 8* hriyCyverax iLprq Z 147 f. . . when the season of Spring comes on, \\'^fiky 817 TTor* ifiai wdpoi IkXv\\xe2\\x82\\xac9 \\xe2\\x82\\xacv^a/jL\\xe2\\x82\\xacvoio . . ^8* In koL vvv fiM rdS* etru^prfqvcv ifXSfop A 453 ff. as thou didst hear my former prayer so now also fulfil this my desire. </p><p>e. avrdp also is used where a causal paiiiicle would be used in English, as oBvygai wewap/Aevoq * avrap otoros | (S/iuo cvt aTtj3ap&lt;p lyXi/Aaro E 399 f. thrilled with pains since the arrow was fixed in his stout shoulder. </p><p>f. In these contrasted clauses, av, avrc, avrdp, ardp, aXXd, as well as 8e, may be used in correlation with /jLcy. </p><p>g. A copulative conjunction is sometimes used where the English uses a disjunctive or, as rpiirXy tct/klttX^ tc A 128 threefold or (and) fourfold, in which prominence is given to the second member. Cf. ha koI 8uo B 346, x^\\'i^ </p><p>irpml^d B 303, Tpt^^a re koi rerpaxBd V 363, O terque quaterque beati, Verg. Aen. I. 94. </p><p>. h. The Homeric poet sometimes puts into an independent clause the incidental thought which in later Greek would be expressed regularly by a participle, as Aaoc 8* ^p-qauvro Oeol^ 18c xelpa^ aLV\\xe2\\x82\\xacaxpv T 318 the people prayed to the gods with uplifted hands (lit. and lifted their hands) for x^H^\\'S ayaxrx6vT\\xe2\\x82\\xac^, cf. /leydX \\xe2\\x82\\xacv;(cto, x^ipa? ^yaax\\'^y A 450; (Zcvs /lepfii^piie c5s *AxiX^) Tifn^frrj, oXiarj Sk iroXia^ iirl vrpjolv ^AxpJMV B 4 was pondering how he might honor Achilles by destroying (lit. and destroy) etc.; cf yXOe ^cpaiv, Ix^^ A 12 f.; AXX* oK&amp;mm KoBrfo-o, cfuu 8* hriireiOeo fivO&lt;^ A 565 for ipj^ TTtiSo/Aevq pvOw.   See \\xc2\\xa7 11 g. </p><p>i. Conversely, the participle, as in later Greek, often contains the principal idea, as Kareycvo\\'cv | *I\\\\tov iKwipauvr cvreix^ov aTrovieaOoL B 113 promised that I should sack Ilios, and return, but in the very next verse is the English idiom, vvv 8c Koicqv airdrrfv PovXcwmTo, koC /eac kcXcvci | dvaxXia \"Apyoi ucea^ai B 114 f. planned an evU deceit and bids me go etc., for hrdr rrjv PovXevau^. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 22. THE HOMERIC DIALECT, a. The dialect of the Homeric poems is in one sense artificial: it was spoken at no place and at no time.  But it is not a mosaic composed of words, and forms chosen capri</p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"31\" id=\"31\"/><p>xxviii </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa722 b. </p><p>cioosly from the different Greek dialects; it is a product of natural growth. The poets unconsciously excluded all that was not adapted to dactylic verse, but they did no violence to their language; they did not wantonly change quantities or introduce new terminations. </p><p>b. The conservation of old forms together with the introduction of new forms was very convenient for the verse; e.g. for the infinitive of the verb to he. Homer could use c/i/ticm as dactyl, _ w w ; cficvai as anapaest, \\\\j \\\\j ; tfjLyuev as trochee, ^ ; tijucv as pyrrhic, \\\\j \\\\j; civou as </p><p>spondee, . Naturally, the choice being offered, metrical convenience determined which of these forms should be used. Metrical convenience often or generally decided between the use of \\'Axatot or *Apy\\xe2\\x82\\xacioL We must always remember that the Homeric dialect was not a modification of the Attic dialect, and was not derived from it, but that it represents an older stage of the language. Many Attic forms can be derived from the Homeric forms. </p><p>c. The same is true in the case of synonyms and stock epithets or phrases, dvai dvSpcuv \\'Aya/ic/ivw is used after the feminine caesura (\\xc2\\xa7 58 y) of the third foot, but \\xe2\\x82\\xacvpv Kpeiwv \\'Aya/icfivwv, \\'Aya/icfivovos \\'ArpciSdo, or \\'Aya/icftvova TroL/Aem Xawv after the masculine caesura of the same foot. HrjXrjia^fa \\'A^^^os is used after the penthemimeral caesura (\\xc2\\xa7 58 e), TToSa? w#cv5 \\'Ax^XXcvs after the hephthemimeral caesura (\\xc2\\xa7 58 g), but iroSdpKrjs 8105 *A;(tAAcvs, 7ro8a)KCos AiaKiSao or a^vfiovo^ AtaKtSao^ ToSapKei HrjXetwvt, Tro&amp;oKca HrfXeCwva, a/iv/xova HrjXeiwva, or *AxtXX.rja, moXiiropBov, after the feminine caesura of the third foot, with SZbs \\'A;(tA3 Xcvs as a tag when the verse is filled up to the Bucolic diaeresis (\\xc2\\xa7 58 ^). Cf. the epithets of Apollo, kKarouo A 385 \\\\j \\\\j \\\\j, iicrjPoXxnj A14 ^ w </p><p>cKocpyos A 479 ^ kj vy, \\xe2\\x82\\xacKaTrjP6\\\\ov A 370 \\\\j \\\\j \\\\j cxan^/ScXeroo </p><p>A 75 w    \\xe2\\x80\\x94       ^ v^.   See \\xc2\\xa7 12 6. </p><p>d. The dialect is essentially Ionic and seems to have originated among the lonians of Asia Minor, influenced possibly by the speech and cer. tainly far more by the old poems of their Aeolian neighbors. The oldest form of Greek Epic songs seems to have been Aeolic, but the lonians brought Epic poetry to perfection. Even the Pythian priestess delivered the oracles of Apollo in Epic verse and Ionic dialect, and the Dorian Spartans sang about their camp-fires the Ionian songs of Tyrtaeus. </p><p>e. Some forms seem to be borrowed from other dialects; but it must be remembered that when the poems were composed, there was less difference between the dialects than at the earliest period when we have monumental evidence concerning them. </p><p>f. Some anomalies of form (as of verse) are as yet unexplained, but it may be assumed that all which remain either (1) were justified by the </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"32\" id=\"32\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa725. </p><p>THE HOMERIC DIALECT. </p><p>zxix </p><p>usage of the people and might be explained by more complete knowledge of the history of the language, or (2) followed the analogy of what was in use, or (3) are errors which have found their way into the text during the course of transmission to the present time. As the poems were handed down among the Greeks at first orally, and afterwards still uncritically for centuries, errors unavoidably crept in and there was a gradual assimilation of what was obsolete to later and more familiar forms, when the older forms were unprotected by the metre. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 23. Vowels and Vowel Changes, a. -q is regularly used for a, as dyopi^y ofioirjy except in Ota goddess, Xao? people, and some proper names (as Aivcias). Occasionally, as B 370, /iav is found instead of the less frequent ftiyv (the strong form of p.fv), SXto A 532 (from aXKopm) is another instance of a, unless it is to be written oXra   (H. 30 D.) </p><p>b. The final a of the stem is retained in the genitive endings -ao and -acDv of the 1st declension, as \\'ArpctlSao A 203. </p><p>c. ao is often changed to ca&gt; by transfer of quantity: *A.rp\\xe2\\x82\\xac&amp;ajo, *Ar/[&gt;Ci8\\xc2\\xa3(tf. Cf, PaxnX^ with Attic jSooxXcW* But the frequent Ado9 never has the Attic form Xcq&gt;9. </p><p>d. Compensative lengthening is sometimes found where it is not in Attic, as $\\xe2\\x82\\xacivo&lt;s (fey/ro?), civcKa (Lesbian Imxa), Kovfyq (^Kopfd), pxnjvo^j </p><p>e. Diphthongs occasionally preserve i where it is lost in Attic before a vowel: cuct, alero^, ctcXcicto (\\xc2\\xa7 47 g), oivoPapcdaVf oXjot-q, irvoLrjy </p><p>f. But I is lost before a vowel in (Sk&amp;i ((okcoi) *lpis B 786, in -co for -oio as genitive-ending of the 2d declension (\\xc2\\xa7 35 6), and in c/xio for ifuio, etc.; cf. Xpixraots A 246 with )(pv&lt;r\\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;a A15. As in Attic, the penult is sometimes short in vuk (as A 489, A 473). In these cases i has turned into the ^sound. Likewise v is sometimes dropped between two vowels. See \\xc2\\xa7 59 A; 8. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 24. Contraction, Concurrent vowels generally remain uncontracted: icicQ&gt;v, aXyeOf iroi? (in nominative and vocative singular), at? (o/ri? = ovis, ewe). Attic ev is regularly ho before two consonants, and the adjective is always cv? or ^ife. Patronymics from nouns in -cvs form -ctSi/s, -cW, as \\xe2\\x80\\xa2Arpcf&amp;75 A 7, HiyXcfwva A 197.   (H. 37 D; G. 846.) </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 25. Synizesis, a. Vowels which do not form a true diphthong may be blended in pronunciation into one long sound: *Ar/[&gt;ci8ea&gt; v-\\' v-\\' , </p><p>tf\\xe2\\x82\\xac0\\xe2\\x82\\xaci8\\xc2\\xabi r 27, 8^ avT\\xe2\\x82\\xac A 340, iroXtos B 811, *l&lt;rriauiv B 537, in which last </p><p>two examples i must have had very nearly the pronunciation of its cognate y-sound. The genitives in -ceo, -ewv are always pronounced with synizesis.  (H. 42 D; G. 47.) </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"33\" id=\"33\"/><p>XXX </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>f 25 b. </p><p>b. Synizesis often served the purpose of the later contraction. -^fUm did not differ in metrical quantity from i^/muv. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 26. Crasis is not frequent. Note rouycxa A 291, uwroi \\xc2\\xa3 396, X^/Acis B 238 (km i7ft\\xe2\\x82\\xacts).   (H. 76; G. 42 ft.) </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 27. Hiatus (H. 75 D; G. 34) is allowed. </p><p>a. After the vowels i and v, as ^x^^ o^ocvrt E 50. </p><p>b. When the two vowels between which it occurs are separated by a caesura (ko^Qoto hnyvdfuffam A 569) or by a diaeresis (\\xc2\\xa7 58 h) : seldom after the first foot (avrap o iyv&lt;a A 333), more frequently after the fourth foot (^yxca o^vocvra E 568). Hiatus between the short syllables of the third foot is allowed nearly as frequently as in all other places together, more than 200 times. This freedom of hiatus emphasizes the prominence of this caesura, \\xc2\\xa7 58 d, </p><p>c. When the final vowel of the first word is long and stands in the accented part of the foot (\\xc2\\xa7 57 a), as    o-c koxq (uotj A 418.   See \\xc2\\xa7 59 i&amp;c. </p><p>d. When a long vowel or diphthong loses part of its quantity before the following vowel (\\xc2\\xa7 59 it), as t^v S* cyw ov \\\\v(r&lt;a A 29, fwy vv rot ov Xpaiafiy A 28. Here the final and initial vowels may be said to be blended. This is called weak or improper hiatus; it is essentially the same as the following. </p><p>e. When the last vowel of the first word is already elided, as fivpC \\'Axcuocs aXye i$rfK\\xe2\\x82\\xacv A 2. </p><p>f. Hiatus before words which formerly began with a consonant (\\xc2\\xa7 32) is only apparent. </p><p>g. The poet did not avoid two or more concurrent vowels in the same word, \\xc2\\xa7 24. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 28. Elision. (H. 79; G. 48.) a. a (in inflectional endings and in &amp;pa aud pa), c, t, o may be elided, ai is sometimes elided in the verb endings, ot is elided seven times in /W, three times in roi, once in &lt;rol A 170 (unless ou8c oxm otco or ov aoi 6m should be read there for oi)8c &lt;T oifo). </p><p>b. TO, irpd, avTL, irepC, ri, and the conjunction ort do not suifer elision; is for ore (either the temporal conjunction or the relative o with rc </p><p>affixed, \\xc2\\xa7 42 m), t for ri or rot. </p><p>c. i is seldom elided in the dative singular, where it seems originally to have been long. </p><p>d. Oxytone prepositions and conjunctions lose their accent in elision; other oxytones throw the acute accent upon the preceding syllable, as ra KOK [xcuca] A 107.  Elision is not left to the reader as in Latin poetry. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 29. Apocope. (H. 84 D; G. 53.) a. Before a consonant, the short final vowel of Sipa and of the prepositions db^ Kara, Trapa, may be cut off </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"34\" id=\"34\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa730 j. </p><p>THE HOMERIC DIALECT. </p><p>xxxi </p><p>(dTTOKom;, dTTOKoirrw). The accent is then thrown back upon the preceding syllable (although it might be more rational to consider it lost as it is in elision). </p><p>b. After apocope, the v of dvd and r of Kara follow the usual rules for consonant changes: dfiweTraXiav T 355, KafiPaXtv E 343 (Karc)3aXev), Kah hi {Kara 8c) frequently, KoKrave Z 164 (icarcKravc), Kamrtacrqv E 560, Koppi^ovaa E 424. </p><p>c. avepvaav A 459 is explained as derived by apocope, assimilation, and vocalization of p, from dm and /rcpvo). </p><p>d. Apocope was no mere metrical license; it was common in the conversational idiom of some dialects. More striking examples of apocope and assimilation than any in Homer are found in prose inscriptions. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 30. Consonants and Consonant Changes, a. Where collateral forms appear, one with single and the other with doubled consonants, the form with two consonants is generally the older or justified etymolog^cally, as woaa-Cf woa-C (from 7ro8-&lt;rt) ; veiKecae, veiKece (vcikos, vctxco\"-), oinrct)9 (oK/:(i)s, cf, Latin quis etc,)j orri, ktX. </p><p>b. Single initial consonants, especially X, fi, v, p, o*, are often doubled (as /:&gt; is in Attic) when by inflexion or composition a short vowel is brought before them (see \\xc2\\xa7 59 A), as cAAtWcro Z 45. </p><p>c. But sometimes p is not doubled where it would be in Attic, as (OKv/MMp E 598, KaT\\xe2\\x82\\xacp\\xe2\\x82\\xac$\\xe2\\x82\\xacv A 361. </p><p>d. Palatal and lingual mutes often remain unchanged before /a, as </p><p>thp\\xc2\\xa3Vy K\\xe2\\x82\\xacKOpvOfl\\xe2\\x82\\xacVOq, </p><p>e. Lingual mutes are commonly assimilated to a following a, as iroa-al (ttoS-o-i). &lt;r is sometimes assimilated to p. or v: Ippjsvai (ttvai) for co-pjevoLj dpy\\xe2\\x82\\xacw6^ white for d/)y\\xe2\\x82\\xaco--vos, as apyewdtuv T 198, hnnjpi for /rco*vu/u (\\xc2\\xa7 32 a), iptfionr^ E 659 dark, cf, \"lEpc^Sos. </p><p>f. o\" is frequently retained before c, as laaopai, ctcXco-cc. </p><p>g. Between p and \\\\or p, p is sometimes developed, as dpPpoT&lt;K from stem pLpo or /uiop (Latin wiors, morior), while in Pporo^ mortal, the p of the stem is lost; pippKtaKt from pXo or pxiK (cf. l/xoXov). </p><p>h. Kdp,paX\\xc2\\xa3 is found occasionally, in the Mss. as a variant reading, a softer pronunciation for Kafifiake (\\xc2\\xa7 29 6). </p><p>i. A parasitic t appears in irroXis, -nToXc/ios for iroXis, ttoXc/aos. Cf. SixOd, rpixOd with Attic hixpiy rpCxO\" The proper names Neoptolemus (NeoirroXc/ios) and Ptolemy (JlToX.\\xe2\\x82\\xacpmos) preserved this t to a late period. </p><p>j. The rough breathing (h) has no power to prevent elision or weaken hiatus. The smooth breathing is found with several words which have the rough breathing in Attic, as dppje (rjpas), vt^P (from mXXopm), i7e\\\\co9 (^fXios), *At8i;s {\"Ai&amp;rjq), lycSs (ca&gt;9). </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"35\" id=\"35\"/><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa730k. </p><p>k. The V movable was written by some ancient critics after the ending -\\xe2\\x82\\xact of the pluperfect, as jScjSXiyKctv E 661, ijvcuyctv Z 170; cf. rjaKW T 388 (170-Kccv). It is freely used before consonants to make a syllable long by position (\\xc2\\xa7 59/). </p><p>1. The final o- of adverbs is omitted more often than in prose. Not merely i$ and ix, ovrctis and ouro), but also ttcSs and ircli, 7roAAaict9 and TroAXaici, Afi^k and afi&lt;t&gt;C (adverbial), are found as collateral forms. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 31. Metathesis of a and p is frequent (H. 64; G. 64): Kop^rj B 452, KfKL^rf a 353; Kofyrurroi. A 266, Kparo9 A 509. Cf. rpaweiofjuev T 441 from T\\xe2\\x82\\xacfyir&lt;t), r\\xe2\\x82\\xacp?rtK\\xe2\\x82\\xacpavvo9 from rpejria. </p><p>For the shifting of quantity from -ao to -co), see \\xc2\\xa7 23 c. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 32. The Digamma, (H. 72 D.) a. The following words seem to have been pronounced by the Homeric poet more or less consistently with initial digamma (vau, p, pronounced as English to) : \\xe2\\x80\\x94 </p><p>ayyvpjL break, 0X19 enough, aXxavax am captured, avai king, avhaym please, dfxuds thin, apvo^ lamb, axrrv city, I, oS, ol him, etc. with a possessive pronoun OS, Tj, 6v (\\xe2\\x82\\xac05 ktX.), cap Spring, eOvoi tribe, ukogl twenty, aK&lt;a yield, elpia say, (future cpccu), iKos far, Ikootos each, cicvpos father-in4aw, iK&lt;ov willing, iXIa-Cia wind, iKiropm hope, hnropj, (/rcc-vu/u) clothe, \\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;r$i^, etfrnra clothes, cTTOs word, Ipyov, epSo) work, ipvw, draw, Itos year. If six, In/s comr panion, ^8vs sweet, (av&amp;iv(i&gt; please), ^^os haunt, lax^ cry aloud, iSctv see, (and oTSo, \\xe2\\x82\\xac?8o9), iKcXos, cotica a7n 19, i^c strength, sinew, To-os e^uaZ, trvs ^//yi oTkos oTvos trine. </p><p>b. Probably lypa (iirl ^pa &lt;^\\xe2\\x82\\xacp&lt;i)v A 572), *I\\\\tos, and Hpis, and several other words, also were pronounced with initial f. </p><p>c. av&amp;ii/a&gt;, I, licvpos, % and others seem to have begun originally with two consonants, &lt;rf. </p><p>d. The verse alone affords no sufficient test for the former existence of f in any word; it only indicates the loss of some consonant. This is not conclusive evidence for p, since o- and j (y) were also lost. Which consonant originally was present has to be learned in each case from inscriptions of other Greek dialects, from a few notes of ancient grammarians, and from other cognate languages (cf Ipycv work, oTvos wine). </p><p>e. The sound of p evidently was going out of use in the Homeric period. It is not infrequently neglected in our texts, and sometimes thi^ neglect seems to be due to the poet himself, but p can be restored in many passages by minor changes. For vi^v jeKyj^oXoy A 21 it is possible to read via ptK-rj^okov, for Travrco-o-i ^ avdxraav A 288 it is easy to read Trao-tv 8c pavdarmv, and x^/^^ peKTfPoXov for ^cpo-tv \\xe2\\x82\\xacKrjP6Xov A 14. Perhaps KTtivai fi\\xe2\\x82\\xacv p dXecivc Z 167 may have been ktciku fitv pe ktX. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"36\" id=\"36\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa734c. </p><p>THE HOMERIC DIALECT. </p><p>xxxiii </p><p>f. That the sound of p was still alive in the Homeric age is shown by the accuracy of the poet in its use where comparative philology shows that it once existed. </p><p>g. f sometimes leaves a trace of its existence in its cognate vowel v: avcpvcrav A 459 for oLfipvauv (\\xc2\\xa7 29 c), ToXavpivw E 289 for raXa-fpivov. So doubtless aTrovpas A 356 for airo-fpds, </p><p>h. Some irregularities of quantity may be explained by this vocalization of f. Thus &amp;tro\\xe2\\x82\\xacnr&lt;ov T 35 may have been &amp;irof\\xe2\\x82\\xacnr&lt;av pronounced nearly as dTrovciTrcov. avuixpi finds its analogy in yeVero laxq A 456 (yeverovuLXij)\\' </p><p>L A neighboring vowel is sometimes lengthened to compensate for the loss of f (\\xc2\\xa7 59 c). </p><p>j. An e was sometimes prefixed to a digammated word and remained after the f was lost, as ^eXScop, itucoa-i, ecpyci, cc. </p><p>k. Sometimes the rough breathing represents the last remnant of a lost consonant (especially in the words which once began with (rp, as av8av(i&gt; KTk.f cf. c above), as \\xe2\\x82\\xacKiov, ccTTrcpos- Often the same root varies in breathing, as av&amp;iv(i&gt; and 178^9, but rjBfK, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 evw/u, but \\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;rOip. </p><p>1.

(H.217; G.292ff.) a. The suffix -^(v), a remnant of an old instrumental case, added to the stem forms a genitive and dative in both singular and plural. </p><p>b. The suffix -Oi is added to the stem to denote place where. </p><p>c. The suffix -Oev is added to the stem to denote j9/ace whence: l&amp;rfiev from Ida, otvpavoOev from heaven. It forms a genitive with the pronominal stems, as c^ev etveica F 128, irpo tOev E 96. </p><p>d. The enclitic -Sc is added to the accusative to denote more distinctly the limit of motion: cmkov^ homeward (also diKaSe, especially of the return of the Achaeans to their homes) ovSe SofwvSe to his own house, aAa&amp; seaward, KXurCqv&amp;e to the tent. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 34. First Declension. (H. 134 ff.; G. 168 ff.) a. 17 is found for final a of the stem with the exceptions mentioned in \\xc2\\xa7 23. </p><p>b. The nominative singular of some masculines ends in -ra for -n^: fjLTjrCera counsellor. Cf. the Latin poeta, nauta. evpvoira far-sounding is used also as accusative, e.g. A 498. </p><p>AU of these words are adjectival (titular) except \\xc2\\xa9vcWa B 107. </p><p>c. The genitive singular of masculines ends in -do or (by transfer of quantity, \\xc2\\xa7 23 c), -ceo. After a vowel this ending may be contracted to -\\xc2\\xab&gt;, as Aiveto) E 534, Bopco) 4^ 692. The ending -ceo is always pronounced as one syllable by synizesis (\\xc2\\xa7 25). </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"37\" id=\"37\"/><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa734d. </p><p>d. The genitiye plural ends in -aa&gt;y or -coiv: BedjiaVf ^ovXcoiv. -coiv ia regularly pronounced as one syllable. </p><p>e. The dative plural ends in -yaiCy) or rarely in -j;?. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 35. Second Declension. (H. 151 ff.; G. 189 ff.) a. The genitive singular has preserved the old ending -to, which affixed to the stem vowel makes -olo. </p><p>b. The temiination -co is indicated by the metre in certain places where all the Mss. give a corrupt form, as o^treXcorov oo kXco^ ov ttot oXeirai B 325. It is to be recognized also in Ilcrcaio B 552 for Ilercaoo, from Ilcrcciis for Ilcrcoos. </p><p>For the loss of t in the change from -ou&gt; to oo, see \\xc2\\xa7 23 /. The -oo was afterwards contracted to ov. </p><p>c. The genitive and dative dual end in -ouv: touv, &amp;fwuv. </p><p>d. The dative plural ends in -ourt(v) or -ots. As in the first declension, the long ending is the rule; the short ending is very rare before a consonant. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 36. Third Declension, (H. 163 ff.; G. 205 ff.) a. The ending i of the dative singular is sometimes long, and sometimes short. It is seldom elided. It is often long before a ^gle consonant: Au fjo/riv droXavros, cf. vTTcp/Acvct &lt;IhXjov B 116. </p><p>b. The dative plural has the Aeolic ending \\xe2\\x80\\xa2&lt;a\\'&lt;n(v) as well as the Attic -&lt;n(y) : iroSco-o-i, troaa-i (\\xc2\\xa7 30 e), ttoo-i, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 av^a-ai, dvSpacri, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Kwcccn, KV&lt;rC. </p><p>c. Nouns in and -V9 usually retain t or v throughout, but in its stead may insert e which is sometimes lengthened. </p><p>d. Nouns in -cvs generally lengthen c to i; in compensation (\\xc2\\xa7 59 c) for the V which between two vowels becomes f and is lost, as jSoo-iAcv?, </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 37. Anomalow forms, a. As verbs appear in the present system with a variety of collateral forms derived from the same root (cf. wcoi, iKaviOy tKvcofuu, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 wevOofmif irwOdvofJuUf \\xe2\\x80\\x94 fieviaj fUfivat, fitfivdCui), so nouns of different declensions are- sometimes formed from the same root and are used without appreciable difference of meaning. </p><p>b. Some nouns have both vowel and consonant stems: oXki^ T 45, but aXw E 299; ip(rjpo&lt;s craipo? A 266, but ipCrfpes craipoi T 378; cf TToXtifras B 806 with TroXirai. </p><p>c. Of V109, three stems are found: (1) vlos, vlov, vU. The other forms of this declension are very rare. (2) vUos, vlct, vi&amp;i as if from vlv^. (3) vUk, vii, via, as from a nominative vU* </p><p>In this word the first syllable is sometimes short (\\xc2\\xa7 23/), as it often is in Attic and in other dialects. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"38\" id=\"38\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa739g. </p><p>THE HOMERIC DIALECT. </p><p>XXXV </p><p>d. Certain names of cities are found in both singular and plural: MvK^ A\" 52, MvK-qvas B 569 ; \\xc2\\xaerjPry: A 378, (^fia^ E 804. Instead of the later plural \\xc2\\xae\\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;T7ruu, TLXaTcuaCf Homer uses only the singular: 0e&lt;nr\\xe2\\x82\\xacuiv B 498, nXarotav B 504. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 38. Adjectives, a. Somie adjectives of three terminations are used as if of two terminations, t.e. the masculine form is used also for the feminine: iipiOCfwv^ ilrvxds A 8, kXvtos *lmro8d/uui B 742, \"^tpa wovXvv E 776, UvXxHo ^fmOoeyroi B 77. </p><p>b. The feminine of adjectives in -vs, ends in -\\xc2\\xaba (gen. -ciiys), -ca (\\xc2\\xa7 23/), or -\\xe2\\x82\\xac17: i3a^\\xe2\\x82\\xac\"\\xc2\\xbb\\xc2\\xbb ^Sa^coys, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 wxca, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 jgo^o/s, PaOirfv. </p><p>c. 7ro\\\\v9 (irovkus) has in the masculine and neuter both stems ttoXv* (ttovXv-) and iroXXo- (for iroKvo-, \\xc2\\xa7 37 a), with a nearly complete set of forms for each: ttoAAo? and woXXov, ttoXcos, ttoXcc?, ttqXccdv, ttoXcWo\\'i, ktX. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 39. Patronymics. (H. 559; G. 846 f.) a. Suffixes which origin nally expressed connection or possession were used to form patronymic adjectives. The original force of these suffixes is occasionally preserved: (0\\xe2\\x82\\xacoi) Ovpaviiuves A 570 is a mere adjective of connection like (^cowriv) IjrovpaviouTi Z 129; Homer does not recognize Ovpavo^ as the ancestor of the gods. \\'OXv/A7ria8c9 funnTcu B 491 is equivalent to fjunkrai \\'OXvfiTria B(OfmT \\xe2\\x82\\xac\\\\ovirai B 484. </p><p>b. Patronymics are frequently used as proper names, cf, \\'ArpaSi;? A 7, Mevoiria^; A 307, before the names Agamemnon-f Patroclus had been mentioned. </p><p>A. c. The patronymic is formed from stems of the 1st declension by adding : kvyqua&amp;io B 624, or more frequently by adding -co&amp;i-: AacpTto&amp;ys r 200. </p><p>d. This analogy, giving an ending in -ia&amp;7s\\xc2\\xbb is followed by stems in -to of the 2d declension: McvotrioSi/s. So also by stems of the 3d declension: HiyXiTuCSew A 1 (as well as HiyXcifSi/s S 316, HiyXctoiva A 197). See j below. </p><p>e. The suffix -t&amp;t- is added to stems in o, and the o is lost as in d above: ILpov&amp;q^y \\xe2\\x80\\x94 also to stems in cv, which lose their v between two vowels {cf, 23 /): \\'ArpeCSvfs A 7, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 also to consonantal stems, as \\'Aya/ufivovCSrii a 30. ^AvOcfjuSvp A 488 is formed as from \"AvOcfw^ rather than from \\'Av^c/uW (*Av^\\xe2\\x82\\xac/uo)vos vioy A 473). </p><p>f. Patronymics from stems in -cv, after the loss of the v, do not hi Homer suffer contraction of the c of the stem with the i of the suffix. The poet says \\'ArpciSi/s, \\'Arpcfoiv, as tetrasyllables not trisyllables. The verse ictus never falls on the ci. </p><p>g. Female patronymics are formed by the suffix -t8- which loses 8 before the nominative sign: XpvfrrfCSa (acc. of Xpv(rrf(s) A 182, BpurrfC8a A 184.  \\'AxouiSes B 235 corresponds to Kovpoi \\'AxajiSiv A 473. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"39\" id=\"39\"/><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa739h. </p><p>B. h. Patronymics are formed also by the suffix -lov : Kpoi^iW A 528 (with genitive Kpono&gt;i/os or KptMovoi), ^Arpetuiv, n^XcicDv. In these last forms from nouns in -cvs the i is always short </p><p>i. The corresponding female patronymic is found in ^Aifyqarivrf E412. </p><p>j. TaXoLovCSao B 566 is irregular; it seems to be formed by a cumulation of suffixes from TaAao9. So AaofjASovria&amp;r/^ (AaofjASovrta&amp;rf T 250) is formed from AaofieSovruys which itself appeal\\'s as a patronymic (in the form AofLcSovrio?) in a Boeotian inscription. </p><p>k. Some adjectives in -io\\xc2\\xab are used as patronymics, as TcAofuavio? Atas B 528. </p><p>1. The patronymics in -81/9 are far more numerous than those in -uaif, </p><p>m. The patronymic is sometimes derived from the grandfather\\'s name: Achilles is called AIolkC^ B 860; Priam, ^ofAivC^ T 303; the two grandsons of Actor, *AKTOp{&lt;ay\\xe2\\x82\\xac B 621. Thus in later poetry, Heracles is called Alcides (\\'AXicaSi;?) from Amphitryo\\'s father \\'AAxaZbs or \\'AXxev?. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 40. Comparison of Adjectives, a. Comparatives and superlatives end in -twv, -ottos more frequently than in Attic.   (H. 253; G. 72.) </p><p>b. dya^os has comparatives dpctW (cf, apurros), PtKrepov, KptCfranWy X&lt;otov, &lt;l&gt;\\xe2\\x82\\xacpT\\xe2\\x82\\xacpOi. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 41. Numerals. (H. 288; G. 372 f.) a. m has a collateral form US Z 422; cf. the feminine form la A 437. </p><p>b. Suo), Svo is indeclinable.  It has the collateral forms SouS^ Socot, ktX. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 42. Pronouns. (H. 261 ff.; G.389 ff.) a. The oblique cases of the 3d personal pronoun when enclitic are * anaphoric,\\' like avrdv ktX. in Attic; when accented they have their original reflexive use, like Attic cavrou, Ipavrav, aeavrovy ktX., which compounds are post-Homeric. </p><p>b. fuv, a\\'&lt;lHi)\\xe2\\x82\\xac, o-^ohV, a\\'&lt;l&gt;Lf 0*^9, and o-^c are always enclitic. </p><p>c. For the relation of the form i/uio to ifiio, of atio to o-co, ktX., see \\xc2\\xa723/ </p><p>d. avros regularly retains its intensive force in the oblique cases, even when not connected with a noun expressed, often marking a contrast nvhich it is difficult to render smoothly in the English idiom. Cf. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7iiy&gt;. </p><p>The presumption is always strongly in favor of the original meaning; but all shades of meaning are found from the strict intensive to the simple anaphoric use of the Attic dialect. </p><p>e. For avrm in the sense of wa-avrm, see g below. In this use it has a large variety of meanings, as (a&lt;^pom t ) avT&lt;os T 220 a mere (simpleton) ; without cause A 520, toithout a prize A 133, absolutely B 138, vainly B 342, without chariot E 255.  Most of these meanings are derived from in the </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"40\" id=\"40\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa743c. </p><p>THE HOMERIC DIALECT. </p><p>zxxvii </p><p>same way as before, the connectioa determining the special sense of each passage. </p><p>f. The Attic article 6, ^, ro, generally retains its demonstrative force in Homer, but like the intensive pronoun in the oblique cases, appears occasionally in its Attic signification. </p><p>In their demonstrative use, 6, ^, ol, at, are best written o, 17, oc^ at. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Toti Tolf Tws are used besides otj at, </p><p>g. Thus the absence of the article does not mark a noun as indefinite; cf. iirjiwu aci&amp; O^a A 1 with arm a virumque cano. Frequently avra&gt;9 is equivalent to Attic wra-vrta^ (ci&gt;9 being the adverb of the article, see / above and \\xc2\\xa7 56 c) while S* avrcos T 339 is equivalent to Attic ouro) S* axravTQis. </p><p>h. The demonstrative article is often followed by a noun in apposition with it, as oi ^ ixdfnjfmv \\'A^cuoi tc Tpwes t\\xe2\\x82\\xac T 111, btU these rejoiced, both Achaeans and Trojans, avrap 6 Povv Upevaev ava( avSpSw ^AytLfjuifivwy B 402 but he, Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed an ox, </p><p>i. The forms with initial t often have a relative force, but refer only to a definite antecedent. This is a relic of paratactic construction (\\xc2\\xa7 21), as is particularly clear in dAAa ra /icv ttoXiW i^etrpajSofJiev ra heSeurrai A 125 but what we took as spoils from the cities, these have been divided, </p><p>j. K\\xe2\\x82\\xacii/os is often found for \\xe2\\x82\\xacKCivo9. </p><p>k. Besides the Attic forms of the relative, o is used for 09, oov (better So, \\xc2\\xa7 35 5) for o5. </p><p>1. The forms 09 and 8 have also a demonstrative use, especially 09 with ovSc, fii^Sc, KOI, and yap. </p><p>For the relative use of the article, see i above. </p><p>m. The neuter o is frequently used as a conjunction, like quod. So also ori and o re. </p><p>n. The indefinite and interrogative pronouns have genitive singular </p><p>TCO, TCl5. </p><p>o. In o Tis for Ss ns (cf, 6 for os, k above), the first stem often remains nninfiected. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 43. CoNJUGATiox. Augment and Reduplication. (H. 354 ff.; G. 610 ff.) a. The augment was for a time considered unessential: whether temporal or syllabic, it may be omitted in the Homeric poems; the accent is then thrown back as far as possible, as rcv^e A 4, oAcKovro A 10, d&lt;^\\'ei A 25. </p><p>b. When the augment is omitted, monosyllabic forms with long vowel take the circumflex accent, as Prj for IjSi;. </p><p>c. Sometimes initial p is not doubled after the augment, as Ipc^c B 400; sometimes initial X, fi, or o- is doubled after the augment </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"41\" id=\"41\"/><p>xxxviii </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa74.3d. </p><p>d. Stems which originally began with a consonant may take the syllabic augment or reduplication, as Icittov, ci/kc, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 cotxa, lopya. </p><p>e. The second aorist active and middle, of verbs whose stem begins with a consonant, is often found with a reduplicated stem, as CKcicXero, dfi7rc7raA.a&gt;v, \\xe2\\x82\\xacT\\xe2\\x82\\xacTfJue, rervKOvro. </p><p>f. The so-called Attic reduplication is more common in Homer than in Attic, and its use extends to the second aorist where the augment also may be used (c/. Attic ijyayw), as ^papc, and the peculiar form -^vCmnrt B 245 from iviTma in which the final consonant of the theme is reduplicated with a as a connective. </p><p>g. SciSoiKa and SctiSca have irregular reduplication; probably these are to be explained as for ScS/rotKa, ScS^ta. </p><p>h. i/AfjLopa (from /jueCpofJuu) and ia-avfuu (from o-cvco) double the initial consonant and prefix c as if they began with two consonants. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 44. Endings, (H. 375 ff.; G. 551 ff., 777 ff.) a. The singular endings, -fu, -ar^a, -aiy occur more frequently than in Attic; especially -/u and -cri in the subjunctive, as ISotfU, dydy&lt;afu, iOikya-ty PaXya-i. These endings are rare in the subjunctive of the contracted fu-forms, as &amp;Scri A 129. </p><p>b. In the pluperfect, the older endings -ca ktX. are preserved. The third person singular ends in -c\\xe2\\x82\\xac(v) or -ctv, as Pefii^Keiv A 221,       B 409. </p><p>c. The second and third persons singular of the first aorist optative active end in -cias, -\\xe2\\x82\\xactc( v), as /ytetVcui?, KoXia-etey. The second person in -ais occurs very rarely. The third person in -at is more common, as yrjOi^irajL A 256. The third person plural ends in -cwti/, as riaeuiv A 42, dKoixrciav B 282. </p><p>d. The third person plural optative active of fu-verbs ends in -tcv, as cfcv, Saftctev, Sotev. </p><p>e. The third person plural imperative ends in -rwv, -aOwv (never -Twrav, -trdwrav). </p><p>f. a. Active infinitives (except in the first aorist) frequently end in -/Acmi, which is sometimes shortened after a short vowel to -/xcv, as cfifici/ai, c/i/uteV) cX^\\xe2\\x82\\xac/t\\xe2\\x82\\xacv(&lt;\")&gt; Te$vdfJU\\xc2\\xa3v((a). </p><p>p. The shortening of -/icm to -/icv occurs generally before a vowel, where it may be called elision. </p><p>y. The ending -vai is found only after a long vowel, as Sovvae. </p><p>g. Aorist passive infinitives end in -fuvoL or -vai. </p><p>h. The second person singular of the middle generally remains uncontracted (\\xc2\\xa7 24), as oSvpau, i&amp;rjai T 130, ^SoAXco A 297. Contracted forms are used occasionally, as ficTaTpeirri A 160, yvtaay B 365, k\\xe2\\x82\\xack\\\\i^ T 138. </p><p>i. In the perfect middle, -ooi regularly loses its c. </p><p>j. -ao retains its a only in the imperative, as ^o-&lt;ro, torao-o. k. The first person plural middle often ends in -/ico^ </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"42\" id=\"42\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa747 e. </p><p>THE HOMERIC DIALECT. </p><p>xxxix </p><p>1. The third person plural of the perfect and pluperfect indicative middle often, and of the optative middle always, ends in -aroi, -aro for -vrax, -vro. Before these endings smooth labial and palatal mutes are aspirated, as CTTirerpa^Toi (perfect passive of CTrtrpciro)). </p><p>m. The third person plural indicative of the aorist passive generally ends in -cv instead of -rj(Tav, as rjyepOev A 57, ifxiavOcv A 200, rpd^^ A 251 8i\\xe2\\x82\\xacTfmy\\xe2\\x82\\xacv A 531.   Cf, the active \\xe2\\x82\\xac-Xv-&lt;ra-v, \\xe2\\x82\\xac-Xvo-v. </p><p>n. SimUarly, v is used for the later -&lt;rav in the imperfect and second aorist of ftt-verbs, as $vyuv A 273, ia-rav, arav, IjSav. </p><p>o. For the optative ending of fit-verbs, in -tcv not htjouv, see d above. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 45. Subjunctive Mode. a. The variable vowel (*connecting vowel*) of the subjunctive is generally short in the first aorist, second aorist of /bi^forms, second aorist passive, second perfect of primitive formation, as Prjarofiev, dyupofjuev, to/xcv, ^cto/xcv, rpaweiofuv, Sa/icicrc, ctSo/icv, ireiroiOofJLev. (H. 373D; G. 780.) </p><p>This short vowel is found before the endings -fjtev, -rov, -re, and in middle forms. </p><p>b. A few forms of the first aorist have a long vowel following the analogy of the present, as Snj^rfoyirai T 107. </p><p>c. There are no certain examples of the short mode-vowel in the present of verbs in -&lt;d. (For jSovXcrai dvrcouras A 67, PavKrfr avricura? may be substituted, etc) </p><p>K.B. The forms of the first aorist subjunctive are easily confused with those of the future, with which they are identical in appearance. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 46. Optative Mode, For the optative endings, see 44 c, d, \\xc2\\xa7 47. Contract Verbs. (H. 409 D; G. 784 ff.) a. Verbs in -ao) exhibit unchanged, assimilated, and contracted forms; the poet\\'s choice between contracted and uncontracted forms seems to have been determined largely by the rhythm. The vowels are regularly contracted when the second is in a short syllable. </p><p>b. Uncontracted forms without assimilation occur rarely, as ircivacov r 25.   (ovra, A 525 and often, is a second aorist, see \\xc2\\xa7 53.) </p><p>c. The rowels of the uncontracted forms are generally assimilated, a prevailing over a following \\xe2\\x82\\xac or ij but being assimilated to o, oi, or ov. These forms are intermediate between the original and the contracted stage. </p><p>d. One of the vowels is usually lengthened in the text of the Mss. Sometimes this appears to be a conformation to Attic usage (\\xc2\\xa7 22/). </p><p>e. Verbs in -cai generally remain uncontracted; except cc, which is generally contracted in the Mss., but often the uncontracted forms are </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"43\" id=\"43\"/><p>xl </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7471 </p><p>metrically possible, co is very rarely contracted except in the participle ending -cv/xcvo? (where contraction occurs to prevent a too frequent recurrence of short syllables, \\xc2\\xa7 59 e). co) is never contracted but is often pronounced as one syllable by synizesis (\\xc2\\xa7 25). </p><p>f. Sometimes the variable vowel c is contracted with c of the stem instead of with the termination. One of these vowels is sometimes dropped^ as dirocupco A 275. </p><p>g. The older form of these verbs, in -cko, is sometimes preserved, as crcXctero A 5, veucctiyo-i A 579.   See \\xc2\\xa7 23 e. </p><p>h. ffiop\\xe2\\x82\\xac(o forms ^pcciv A 144, ^op^m B 107. </p><p>i. Verbs in -oa&gt; are generally contracted. Sometimes they have forms with the double o sound, like verbs in -oo), as iarpaTotavro T 187 (which might be written carparooyro). </p><p>\\xc2\\xa748. Tenses. Future and First Aoristy Active and Middle. (H.420ff.; G. 777.) a. Pure verbs which do not lengthen the stem-vowel in the formation of the tenses, often have double a in the future and first aorist, active and middle. </p><p>b. In the future the &lt;r of the before-mentioned verbs often disappears, as KoXiovaa T 383, ^Xctrcu B 325. </p><p>c. Stems in S often show double a in the aorist. </p><p>d. Most of these forms with aa may be explained as original or assimilated, as vciKco-o-c from the theme vcucco- (c/. veiKos), KOfAioxraro for K0fu8aaro (cf. ko/u8i;). Thus the stem-vowel of these verbs was not final originally, and hence is not lengthened in the future and aorist. </p><p>e. Some stems in X and p retain the cr of the future and aorist (as some do in Attic), as HXxrajL A 409, Kvpcras T 23, wpce A 10. </p><p>f. The so-called Doric future with tense-sign o-c, is foimd in iaadrtu B393. </p><p>g. Some verbs have a future without tense-sign, as cTfu, KoxKeiovrei to lie down, cSo/xot, irCofjuUf ipvta. Most of these verbs are old presents which acquired a future signification, elpj, is not always future in Homer, c/*. B. 87. </p><p>h. Some verbs form the first aorist active and middle without a, as Ix^cv Z 419 (from       ^^r ^x^)\\' \\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;\\'\\'0\\'\\xe2\\x82\\xacva E 208, iicrfa A 40 from Ktu&lt;a. </p><p>i. The first aorist often has the variable vowel of the second aorist &lt;&gt;/c, as Ifov, SwcTo. So in the imperative, as jSi/crco E 109, Jpaco F 250, afcrc r 105, oio-crc r 103; infinitive, outc/acvoi F 120; participle, imPrjaoiiaw E46. </p><p>j. Verbs in -{w often have themes in y, and thus futures and first aorists in -(ta and -(a, as cjoAaTro^at A 129, irrokepu^ofjuev B 328. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 49. Perfect. (H. 446 ff., 490; G. 682 ff.) a.

The active and middle forms opav (about 40 times) and bpaxrOai (about 20 times), tSctv (more than 200 times) and i^irOax (90 times), are used often without appreciable difference of meaning.   C/. l&lt;#ttTc B 807,      A 584. </p><p>b. The first aorist middle is sometimes used without difference of meaning from the second aorist active, as jSi/crcTo, V 262, l^i; A 311; cSv0-6TO r 328,18v r 36. </p><p>c. The future middle is sometimes used as passive, as rcXcco^ B 36. C/. 51 e. </p><p>d. The aorist middle is often used as passive.

The second aorist subjunctive passive usually remains uncontracted, and follows the rule of /u-verbs (\\xc2\\xa7 52 c). </p><p>d. In the second aorist subjunctive, the passive suffix is often long (and the mode 70wel short in the dual and in the first or second person plural, \\xc2\\xa7 45 a), as &amp;if\\xc2\\xbb7i79 T 436 {SdfivYffu), rpaweCofiev T 441 (t^o&gt;, \\xc2\\xa7 31), but pxyiwTiv B 475 (fuay&lt;o), </p><p>e.

For the ending -v for -&lt;rav, see \\xc2\\xa7 44 n. </p><p>o. The second aorist subjunctive active generally remains nncontracted. The stem vowel often appeai-s in its long form with short mode vowel in the dual and in the first and second persons plural (c/. \\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa7 45 a, 51 d), as ^&lt;nv A 324, ^cio/icv A 143 (better Orjofjuev, Attic ^ficv), yviown A 302, iptiofjusv A 62 (better iprjofjueif, as from an iprffu), </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 53. Second Aorists without Variable Vowel. (H. 489; G. 125, 3.) Many second aorists, active and middle, are found without variable vowel, following the analogy of verbs in -/u, as SXro A 532 (oAAofuu), lyvo) A 199, Ukto B 420 (S\\xe2\\x82\\xacxofJim), p\\\\^o A 518 (^c\\xc2\\xa3Ua)), k\\\\v$i A 37, kXvt\\xe2\\x82\\xac B 56 (icXvw), ovra Z 64, \\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;r(rvTO B 809 (&lt;r\\xe2\\x82\\xacva&gt;). </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 54. Iterative Forms, (H. 493; G. 778.) a. Iterative forms of the imperfect and aorist indicate the repetition of a state or action. The augment is generally omitted. These forms are characterized by the suffix -o-K, and have the inflection of the imperfect of verbs in -o&gt;. They are confined to the Ionic dialect. The iterative idea is frequently waning and occasionally is lost. </p><p>b. Verbs in -co add the endings -o-kov or -a-KOfiriu to the c-form of the stem of the present or second aorist, as co-kc, cittco-kc, iScotkc. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 55. Prepositions, a. Prepositions often retain their original adverbial force (as iv 3c but therein, irapa 8c and beside him). They may be placed after the verbs or nouns with which they are connected. See \\xc2\\xa719 6.   (H. 785; G. 1222ff.) </p><p>b. The preposition is often separated from the verb which it modifies, as Trap 8c Kc&lt;^aAAi7vo)v oft^l ortxcs ovk aXairahval \\\\ earaxrav A 330 f., where vdp modifies corcurav. </p><p>o. Anastrophe, (H. 109; G. 116.) a. Disyllabic prepositions, when they immediately follow the word with which they are construed, take the accent upon the penult, except d/x^i, dvri, dm, 8(d. ova Z 331 stands for dvafTTYfOi.   Ivt is used for Ifvcuri or Ivcori, lirt for Ittcoti, /lera for </p><p>flCTCOTt. </p><p>p. Elided prepositions suffer anastrophe only when they as adverbs modify a verb to be supplied, as or* T 45 for hrtfm, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or by way of exception, in order to avoid ambiguity, as c^* A 350, to show that the preposition is to be connected with the preceding word. </p><p>d. a. cv has the parallel forms ctv, cn. ctv stands only in the part of the foot which receives the ictus, and its use is nearly confined to certain phrases, as civ dyofyg, ctv *Ai8ao Sofjuouriv. </p><p>p. The poet uses both h and ci9, Trpos, irporl, and ttot^ viro and </p><p>VJTOJL. </p><p>f. d/A^t, dvd, and fierd are used also with the dative. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"46\" id=\"46\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa767 d. </p><p>HOMERIC VERSE. </p><p>zliii </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 56. Adverbs. (H.257ff.; G.365ff.) a. A predicate adjective is often used where the English idiom has an adverb or an adverbial phrase, as x^^o^ \\'^Pv ^ yesterday, rjepttf A 497 early in the </p><p>morning, iram^fiepioi. A 472 cdl day long, irprpnj^ E 58 (pronus) on his face, </p><p>irpo^^pm willing is used only predicatively, where the English idiom uses willingly. </p><p>b. Adverbs ending in -a are common: o-a^ rax^ cSko. These seem to have been originally neuter cognate accusatives, and many are such still; cf, TToAA\\' circrcAAc, iroXXa rjparo, fieya vj/ttic, fuyaX evx^ro, ktX. </p><p>o. Adverbs in -m are not common; they are most frequent from o-stems: ovrois (ouro9)\\xc2\\xbb (Ss (o), avrois (avrds), kokqis (kokos). lo-cus and 6fu&gt;io&gt;9 are not found, KoXm only p 63, ^iXcus only A 347. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa757. HOMERIC VERSE. The Heroic Hexameter, (H. 1064 ff., 1100; G. 1668 f.) a. The poems are to be read with careful attention to the metrical quantity of each syllable, as well as to the sense of the passage. There are six feet (bars or measures) in each verse; hence the name hexameter. Emphasis or stress of voice is laid on the first syllable of each foot. The part of the foot which has no ictus (the arsis) should receive as much time though not so much stress as the ictus-syllable (the thesis). The rhythm would be called } time in modern music. The English hexameter (found e.g, in Longfellow\\'s Evangeline) is generally read as of | time. </p><p>b. The written word-accent is to be disregarded in reading Homeric verse. Occasionally the verse-ictus and word-accent may coincide, but the word-accent seems to have had no influence on the formation of the verse. </p><p>o. The dactyl (J ^^or_ww), with the ictus on the first syllable, is the fundamental and prevailing foot of Homeric verse. It is often replaced by a spondee^ or heavy dactyl (J  J or ). </p><p>Dactyls are about three times as frequent as spondees in the Homeric poems. </p><p>d. Verses in which each of the first five feet is a dactyl are far more common in Homer than in Vergil: there are 160 in the first book of the Iliad alone. Many frequently recurring verses have this rhythm; as rov ^ a/nufuipofuvoi vpoo\\'iKlyrf iro&amp;as cofcv? *A)(iXX\\xe2\\x82\\xacik, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 avrap ciret iroaio^ Kal iSvjTvoq ii Ipov crro. Many other verses have but one spondee (generally in the first foot) among the first five feet; as ^/xos 8* 171X10$ icarcSv Kxa ciri </p><p>^ This name was derived from the use of this slow, solemn measure in the hymns which accompanied the libation (jintovl4i) to the gods. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"47\" id=\"47\"/><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa767 e. </p><p>e. Spondees are most common in the first two feet; they are more and more avoided in each foot toward the close of the verse. </p><p>f. The first foot allows more freedom than any other. A short vowel there more frequently retains its natural quantity before a mute and a liquid, and yet la more frequently lengthened in the unaccented part of the foot before that combination. At the close of the first foot, hiatus is allowed (\\xc2\\xa7 27 6). </p><p>g. The Bucolic diaeresis (\\xc2\\xa7 58 h) is seldom immediately preceded by a word of three long syllables. Before this diaeresis, a dactyl is strongly preferred. </p><p>h. Verses which have a spondee in the fifth foot are called spondaic verses (cm; airaySeuucd). They are more common in Homer than in the Latin poets,\\xe2\\x80\\x94about iper cent of the verses of the Iliad being spondaic. </p><p>i. These spondaic verses seem especially frequent at the close of emphatic sentences or of divisions of the narrative (cf, A 21, 157, 291, 600) and in descriptions of suffering and toil, but often no rhythmic effect is sought; the convenience of the verse determined the measure. </p><p>j. The last foot in each verse is a spondee, but the final syllable may be short; the deficiency in time is then made up by the slight pause which follows at the end of the verse (\\xc2\\xa7 59 a, /). A heavy or consonantal ending is preferred; hence the v-movable is often used. </p><p>k. The student need not concern himself about elision as in Latin poetry; that is already done in the text; but he must be watchful for synizesis (\\xc2\\xa7 25). </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 58. Caesural Pauses. (H. 1081; G. 1642.) a. Each verse has one or more caesural pauses (caesura = to/lliJ cutting)^ \\xe2\\x80\\x94 pauses within a foot. </p><p>b. The principal caesura of the verse is always a pause in the sense, and is often emphasized by punctuation, but occasionally commas are found where no pause is necessary. </p><p>Of course no pause can be made immediately before an enclitic, since this is closely connected with the foregoing word. </p><p>o. A caesura is almost always found in the third foot; only 185 verses of the Iliad and 71 of the Odyssey have no pause there. It occurs either after the ictusnsyllable (as fjojviv aciSc Ota A niyXi/ta&amp;o) \\'A;(iX^o5 A 1 </p><p>v/vl \\xe2\\x80\\x94 A \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 vv/l l)&gt;or between the </p><p>two short syllables (as av8pa fwi cwcttc Movora A iroAvrpoirov os fm\\\\a </p><p>iroXXa al, \\\\       w l_-*^A*^|_-vvy| \\xe2\\x80\\x94 v/wl !)\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 These </p><p>two caesuras are about equally frequent; but the second slightly predominates and seems to have been preferred. </p><p>d. The importance of the caesura in the third foot is marked not only by the freedom with which hiatus is allowed there (\\xc2\\xa7 27 b), and by </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"48\" id=\"48\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa758k. </p><p>HOMERIC VERSE. </p><p>xlv </p><p>the evident avoidance of elision at that point, but also by the large number of tags of verses which are suited to follow it; as irarrjp avSpStv T\\xe2\\x82\\xac OeStv TC, PoSnri^ irorvta \"^pvf, $\\xe2\\x82\\xaca XcvkcoAcws \"H/m;, ^ca yAavKowrt? \\'Aftyny, &lt;l&gt;i\\\\ofifij\\xe2\\x82\\xaci8rf^ \\'A^po&amp;Ti;, Ato9 Ovydrrjp \\'A^po&amp;riy, evicn^/titScs \\'A^auK, *A)(ajMv )(aXKO)(iriavii}v, Koprq KO/xoovrcs \\'Ayajuoi^ apiffL&lt;l&gt;iXoi McveAoos, dva^ OLvSplav *Ayafi\\xe2\\x82\\xac/Ltvo)v, P&lt;njv dyajSb^ /Siio/irjSvj^, TtpijvuK Unrora Ncorcop ktX. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all of which must be preceded by the feminine caesura (see /) of the third foot; while \\'Aya/jic/tivoi/os ^ArpeiBou}, evpv Kputov \\'Aya/Ltc/tivcDv, ijyijTop\\xe2\\x82\\xac9 ftcSoKTCs, aTraftci^CTo ^vivtj(T\\xe2\\x82\\xacv TC ktX. must be preceded by the masculine caesura of the third foot.  See \\xc2\\xa7 22 c. </p><p>e. The pause after the first syllable of the third foot is called the penthemimeral caesura (ircvrc, ijfu-, ficpos) because it comes after the fifth half-foot; it divides the verse into 2 J + 3 J feet. The pause between the two short syllables of the third foot divides the verse into 2| + 3} feet. </p><p>f. The pause after an ictus-syllable is called a masculine caesura because of the vigorous movement which it gives to the verse. The pause between two unaccented syllables is called a feminine caesura. </p><p>g. Sometimes the principal pause of the verse is the masculine caesura of the fourth foot. This is called the hephthemimeral caesura (eirra, tipx-, fUpoi), It is frequent after a feminine caesura of the third foot. It gives an energetic movement after a penthemimeral caesura, when the verse is divided into 2i + 1 + 2} feet. </p><p>h. Sometimes the pause of the verse is at the close of the fourth foot; this is called the Bucolic diaeresis (a diaeresis being a pause at the end of a word between two feet) or caesura, since it is most evidently aimed at in the bucolic or pastoral poetry of Theocritus. Occasionally there is a transition at this point to another part of the story, as A 318, 348, 430. This Bucolic diaeresis with the penthemimeral caesura divides the verse into 2i + l} + 2feet. </p><p>i. The importance of the Bucolic diaeresis is marked by the large number of tags of verses which are ready to follow it, as Stb? \\'08v&lt;r&lt;rcv5, IpKOi \\'A)(ajuov, imrora Ncorw/a, o^pifios \"Aprf^y ^xuSifjm ^EKTtap, $01^09 \\'AirdAAcDv, IlaAAas \\'AOT^vrf, ^ Ocdiav, firfrUra Zcv9\\xc2\\xbb uroBw ^ciis. See \\xc2\\xa7 22 c.  Hiatus is allowed here occasionally.   See \\xc2\\xa7 27 h, </p><p>j. A slight pause occurs about as often, after the first short syllable of the fifth foot.  The poet prefers to close the verse with the rhythm </p><p>\\\\jy \\\\j (where the comma represents the end of a word) rather </p><p>than  ; hence ovrc reA.eo-(ras A 108, not aSr\\' cTcXcororas, and </p><p>dXy\\xe2\\x82\\xac tOrjKev A 2, not oXyea $rjK\\xe2\\x82\\xacv. </p><p>k. The principal pause of the verse is seldom found at the close of the third foot.  This would divide the verse into two equal parts and </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"49\" id=\"49\"/><p>xlyi </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7581. </p><p>cause monotony. A word ends there not infrequently, but is accompanied by a more prominent caesura in the third or fourth foot; as evBa i3oK irXciOTouf ^pvyaq avcpas T 185, where the last two words are so closely connected that no caesura is felt between them. </p><p>L Even a slight pause is rare between the two short syllables of the fourth foot. In jcot iirttBero /ivO^ A 33, the objectionable pause might be avoided by omitting the augment, but the conjunction is connected with the verb so closely that no caesm*a is felt. </p><p>m. No sentence ends with the second foot. </p><p>n. The pause in the third foot gives to the rest of the verse an anapaestic movement, from which it is often recalled by the Bucolic diaeresis. </p><p>o. The varied position of the main caesura, and the minor pauses in different parts of the verse, give perfect freedom from monotony without detracting from the grace and dignity of the measure. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 59. QuANTiTY.i (H. 92 ff.; G. 98 ff., 1622.) a. Metrical convenience or necessity often determined the poet\\'s choice among synonymous words (\\xc2\\xa7 22 a-c). The poet in general preferred the light dactyls to the heavy dactyls or spondees, and retained in the \\xc2\\xa3pic dialect a large number of dactylic forms which were aftei*wards contracted.   An amphi</p><p>macer (_ v/ , d/x^i, fuucpov) was avoided often by means of apocope, </p><p>synizesis, or elision. </p><p>Most exceptions to the rules of quantity are only apparent. The poet, for example, did not lengthen a short syllable by placing the ictus upon it. If an apparently short final syllable stands where a long syllable is expected, it is probable either </p><p>(1) that the final syllable was originally long, and later lost part of its quantity; or </p><p>^ The beginner will find it convenient to remember concerning a, i, u, the vowels whose quantity is not clear at the first glance, that </p><p>(1) they are short in the final syllable of any word when the antepenult has the acute or if the penult has the circumflex accent; </p><p>(2) they are regularly short in infiectional endings, as ixdxv^^* ^ptaa^ rpfwown, rdBtmiKa,\\xe2\\x80\\x94in the final syllables of neuter nouns, as 8\\xc2\\xa3/\\xc2\\xaba, ^fiap, fi\\xe2\\x82\\xac\\\\i, ddnpv,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 in suffixes, except where v has been lost before o-, as (f&gt;^aU, 8oMi}s, ^olyiaaa, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in particles, especially in prepositions, as iiyd, irepi, ^6, apa, in, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and generally in the second aorist stem of verbs; </p><p>(3) they are long in the final syllable when the penult is long by nature and has the acute accent; </p><p>(4) they are long when they are the result of contraction, as irlfM from irifjuLt, ip6v, from Up6v, and as the final vowel of the stem of nouns of the first declension. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"50\" id=\"50\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa759e. </p><p>HOMERIC VERSE. </p><p>xlvii </p><p>(2) that the following word has lost an initial consonant which would have made the preceding syllable long by position (see j below); or </p><p>(3) that the pause (musical rest) of a caesura or diaeresis, fills out the time occupied by the foot, allowing the same freedom as at the end of the verse (\\xc2\\xa7 57 j), </p><p>b. A considerable number of anomalies, however, remain unexplained. Prominent among the unexplained anomalies of quantity is the I of certain abstract nouns, which form such a definite class that it may be assumed that there was some explanation, perhaps physiological, for them all. </p><p>c. Many apparently irregular variations of natural quantity, as well as apparent freedom in allowing hiatus, and variations of quantity made by position (see j below), are to be explained by the loss of a consonant, e.g. -AiSos T 322 but \\xc2\\xabAt8t A 3, from a-fiS (\\xc2\\xa7 32), fji\\xe2\\x82\\xacfjLa&lt;rav B 863 but fUfidorts B 818 (ftc/ia/rore?)* </p><p>d. a. A syllable which contains a long vowel or a diphthong is long by nature. Final cu and oi are metrically long, although short as regards accentuation. </p><p>p. The quantity of some vowels is not fixed, as ^AttoWqivo? A 14, AAiroXXcDv, A 380; \\'Ape?, \"Api^ E 31 (if the text is right). </p><p>y. Most of these vowels with variable quantity were originally long and were becoming short, as the Homeric lo-os, icaXos, and ^apos, became loros, icaXo9&gt; and &lt;f&gt;dpoi in Attic poetry, fuapivo (cf, ^pvj euxpivif B 471), Attic iapivosi is found on a Boeotian inscription. Evidently every vowel which at first was long and afterwards became short must have had at some time a metrical quantity which could be treated either as long or short, ue. its quantity was variable. </p><p>8. For the length of final i in the dative singular of the third declension, see \\xc2\\xa7 36 a. wpCv in vpiv avr Z 81 retains its original length, as a contracted comparative. </p><p>\\xe2\\x82\\xac. With this variation of natural quantity may be compared the double forms employed in Homer, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one with a single consonant, another with two consonants, as \\'Ax^AXcvs A 54,\\'AxtXev\\'s A 199; \\'OSvoro-cvs A 430, \\'OSwcvs A 494; TpiKKrfv B 729, TpU-qs A 202; ottttcus A 344, &amp;jrm A 136; pjsxraoif r 266, /ico-ov A 481, KT^, many of which doubled consonants are known to be justified etyraologically. </p><p>e. Sometimes a naturally short vowel was lengthened (not by the poet, but in the speech of the people) in order to avoid the too frequent recurrence of short syllables. This is illustrated by the rule for the use of o or 0) in the comparison of adjectives ((ro^a&gt;repo9 but Kov&lt;^or\\xe2\\x82\\xacpos), and by the words which have a vowel similarly lengthened in the Attic * </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"51\" id=\"51\"/><p>xlviii </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>S59\\xc2\\xa3 </p><p>dialect (as iOavaroi, trfKunf^fopo^^ \\\\nrrfpmj9)\\xc2\\xbb We find Sin^p but av^?, UpXafws but JlpiofuSvii, $vyarrfp but Ovydrepau </p><p>f. a. In Homeric verse a syllable which contains a short vowel is long by position when the vowel is followed by a double consonant ^, if/) or by two or more consonants, whether these are in the same or in the following word or are divided between the two words. </p><p>p. This rule holds good also in case of a mute followed by a liquid. This combination rarely fails to make position within a word, and generally makes position when it stands at the beginning of a word, especially when this word is closely connected with the preceding. </p><p>g. a. Sometimes a vowel remains short before a mute followed by X or as ^A&lt;l&gt;po&amp;iTrf T 380, &amp;p,4&gt;XPpanji B 389, &amp;fx&lt;l&gt;XSpv&lt;li^ B 700, Trp&amp;rpair&amp;r$ai Z 336, vcvore KpoviW A 528, jSaXe Upea/uSao F 356, yap pa KAvraipvqarpvfi A 113. These words and phrases could not have been brought into the verse if the mute and liquid must make length by position, and the history of the language shows that this combination of mute and liquid was gradually losing its weight. </p><p>p. That a mute and liquid do not always make length by position is explained by the ease with which the combination can be pronounced at the beginning of a syllable, leaving the preceding vowel short. </p><p>y. Before four words, two of which begin with the double consonant { and two with the two consonants o-jc (not a mute and a liquid), the preceding vowel remains short: oi re ZokwOov B 634, oi 8c ZeXciav B 824) irpoxtovTo ^KapdvSptov B 465, iTreira a-Keirapvoy c 237. </p><p>h. a. A single X, /a, v, p, &lt;r, at the beginning of certain words, may make position (cf. \\xc2\\xa7 30 : lirea vi&lt;^a8carari T 222 (cf, dya-m&lt;^ A 420 and English snow), </p><p>p. So also 8 makes position in the stem Bpi- (8curai fear), and always In Siyv long, as iBciaev ^ 6 ycpw A 33, ov ti pkXa Sijv A 416. </p><p>i. a. Cognate languages and collateral dialectic forms show that most words which in the Attic dialect began with p, once began with a-p or pp. This explains the doubling of the p after the augment and in composition, as well as its power to make position in Homeric verse. </p><p>p. Of the instances of lengthening before p, most are only physiologically explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the prsoimd being easily continued until it is virtually a double consonant. But this lengthening occurs only before certain stems, not before iia\\\\\\xe2\\x82\\xacodax, pmtv, poGvos ktX. </p><p>j.

A long final vowel or diphthong in the arsis of the foot is regularly shortened before a following vowel: \\'ArpciStu re koI SXXoi ivicviffu&amp;s *A;(tuoi A 17, rtfv ^ cyw ov Avcro) A 29. The shortening of a long vowel is essentially the elision of half the vowel (\\xc2\\xa7 27 &lt;/). </p><p>fi. Final ou, oc, a are most frequently shortened before an initial vowel. Final oc is shortened eight times as often as final 17. </p><p>y. The diphthongs with v seem to have been more firm in retaining their quantity than those with i. </p><p>8. This shortening of diphthongs seems to indicate a tendency of the final I or V of the diphthong to go into its cognate y {J} or w (p) sound and disappear (cf, \\xc2\\xa7 23/). In Pindar, also, a final diphthong is shortened five times as often as a long final vowel. Of course there was no hiatus as long as the j or p was spokeo. </p><p>c. Final ^ and are shortened before an initial vowel more rarely than other diphthongs. &lt;^ is seldom shortened except before an e or (less frequently) an a. </p><p>1. Before a pause (as before the close of the verse, see \\xc2\\xa7 57 j), a short vowel may be used in place of a long vowel: iiaripaax Upidfwio voXxv </p><p>A 19 \\\\       Kj I^A.   Not infrequently thus the short final </p><p>vowel of a vocative takes the place of a long syllable, even co vie IIcreaM) A 338; in such cases the nominative form frequently could be used. The pause in the rhythm occupies the remainder of the time which would be spent in pronouncing a long syllable, J = J Before a pause, also, a long final vowel may preserve its quantity although the following word begins with a vowel. </p><p>m. A few verses seem to begin with a short syllable, as 09 ^817 ra r ioirra A 70 (for Ss \\xc2\\xa7 32). </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"53\" id=\"53\"/><p>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE. </p><p>The Homeric Mss. are better and more ancient than those of any other secular Greek author. In all, more than one hundred are known and described. The most valuable for the Homeric text, and far the most valuable for the old Greek Commentary (2x&lt;&gt;^)&gt; ^ known as Venetus in the library of San Marco at Venice. It contains the entire Iliad, with Introduction and Scholia, on 325 leaves of parchment in large folio, 15x11 inches. It was written not later than the eleventh century of our era. </p><p>The earliest printed edition of Homer was that of Demetrius Chalcondylas, in two large and handsome volumes, Florence, 1488. </p><p>The most important critical editions of the Iliad, are those of Bekker (1858), La Roche (1873), Nauck (1877), Christ (1884). </p><p>Convenient text editions are those of Dindorf-Hentze (Leipzig, 1884) and Cauer (Leipzig, 1890). </p><p>The most scholarly English edition of the entire Iliad, is as yet that of Leaf, in two volumes, London, 1886, 1888. </p><p>The most convenient small work treating of (a) the general literary characteristics of the poems, (li) the Homeric world, (c) Homer in antiquity, (d) the Homeric question, is Homer; An Introduction to the Iliad and the Odyssey by Professor Jebb, Boston, 1887. </p><p>Homer, a * literature primer,\\' by Gladstone, New York, 1878, will be suggestive and helpful to many, although it is not to be compared with Professor Jebb\\'s work. </p><p>The * Homeric question\\' is clearly stated in The Origin of the Homeric Poems, by Bonitz, translated by Professor Packard, New York, 1880. </p><p>Matthew Arnold\\'s Essay On translating Homer, in Essays in Criticism, makes distinct the most prominent characteristics of Homeric style. </p><p>Monro\\'s Grammar of the Homeric Dialect, Oxford, 1891, is by far the best work on the subject in the English language. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"55\" id=\"55\"/><p>JjUm4^    /      :,u:CJi^    /AjL^~:y^ .yt^iycX^ </p><p>) </p><p>OMHPOT lAIAAOS A. </p><p>^\\'AX^a        Xpierov, \\\\otfihtf arparov, ^x^^\\' ftydtermp.

Prooemium: The wrath of Achilles, from its very heginningy and the destructive consequences which followed in accordance with the will of Zeus, This is the principal theme of the Iliad, The First Book serves as an introduction to the whole poem. It narrates the story of the strife between Achilles and Agamemnon, and the decree of Zeus, which is made on the intercession of Thetis. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 The events narrated in A occupy 21 days. See \\xc2\\xa77 a. </p><p>1. |&amp;i|viv: wrath, lasting anger, the memorem iram of Verg. Aen. i. 4. Cf 81, 247, 488. This receives prominence as being most important for the subject of the poem. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 The definite article is \"\"ot needed in early Greek. The connection decides, as it does in Latin, whether it should be used in translation. See \\xc2\\xa7 42 g. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 0cd: i.e. the Muse. Homer does not assign special names and offices to different muses. See on B 484.

Homer often drops one of two doubled consonants.   See \\xc2\\xa7 59 rf </p><p>2. oiXo|Uvi|v: destructive, deadly, cf Milton Par. Lost i. 2, * forbidden fruit. .. whose mortal taste | Brought death into the world.\\' This is put in a kind of apposition with fiffviv, as if it were an afterthought. The idea is amplified in the following relative clause, cf 10, B 227; see \\xc2\\xa7 12 e. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 |ivp^: countless; not a numeral in Homer. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 For the * elision\\' of a, see \\xc2\\xa7 28 a. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 For the * hiatus,* allowed when the final vowel has been elided, see \\xc2\\xa7 27 g. \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'AxaioCs: often used for all the Greeks, see \\xc2\\xa7 5 a. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 aX-yfa [aXyrf]: i.e. the defeats caused by the absence of Achilles from the conflict. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 For the uncontracted form, see \\xc2\\xa7 24. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 c0t|kcv: caused (as T 321, see \\xc2\\xa7 17), nearly equiv. to rc^xc below, or to the Attic itroCrfo-ci/, </p><p>3. iroXXAs: the second clause of the relative sentence is closely connected with the first, since iroXXas repeats the idea of fivpui, while the third clause is added in the form of a contrast, avrovs ktX, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 l^OCftovs [Attic Kpartpds\\'] : the feminine form i&lt;l&gt;OLfm^ is used by Homer only of persons.

The Catalogue seems to have been prepared for an account of the mustering of the Greeks at Aulis and the embarkation thence (cf, 509 f.), and to have been inserted here with divers alterations. We expect here an account of the forces, not of the ships. </p><p>The nations, their leaders, and the number of their ships are enu\\xc2\\xab merated in a definite geographical order, in three principal divisions: I. (a) The main land of Greece south of Thermopylae; (6) middle and southern Greece with the islands immediately adjoining. 16 contingents. (494-644.) II. Insular Greece, from Crete to Calydnae. 4 contingents. (645-680.) m. Thessalian Greece, from Mts. Oeta and Othrys on the south, to Olympus on the north. 9 contingents. (681-759.) See p. vii. of the Vocabulary. </p><p>The Achaean ships number in all 1186. The number of men on each ship is stated for only two contingents: each Boeotian ship carried 120 men (510); each of the ships of Philoctetes brought 50 men (719). The ships of Achilles also brought each 50 men (11170). From the average of the two numbers given for the Boeotians and the ships of Philoctetes, the ancients reckoned the whole number of Achaeans before Troy as about 100,000. Others reckoned the ships roundly as 1200, assigned 100 men to each ship, and thus estimated the whole number of Achaeans as 120,000. </p><p>The Greeks valued this list highly, because of its geographical and statistical information. They looked upon it as a part of history, a versified geography and gazetteer. They appealed to it to settle disputed questions, and the charge of interpolating verses in it was like a charge of falsifying public records. </p><p>The poet evidently desires to represent this expedition as a great national undertaking. He enumerates even those nations which from their inland position were not likely to have had anything to do with such a war, e,g, the Arcadians (603-614), who are not mentioned in the rest of the Iliad as taking part in the battles on the plain of Troy. The poet does not seem to exalt one nation at the expense of another, either here or in the other parts of the Iliad, A bard wandering from country to country would acquire a wealth of geographical information, but would form no strong local attachments. </p><p>\\'EAAas and the \\'EAXtvcs in this Catalogue are restricted to a part of Thessaly, 683 f. The Dorians and lonians are not mentioned. No Greek colonies are known, whether in Asia Minor, in Sicily and the West, or elsewhere.  The names Peloponnesus, Attica, Eleusis, Megara, Delphi, </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"206\" id=\"206\"/><p>85 </p><p>Olympia, and Pisa, do not appear. Thus this Catalogue seems to have been composed before the Dorian migration into Peloponnesus, and the sending forth of colonies to Asia Minor and the West. </p><p>494-644.   I. Greece south of Thermopylae, with the adjoining islands, </p><p>494-558. Boeotia, Phocis, Locris, Euboea, Athens, Salamis, The enumeration proceeds from Boeotia in a northerly direction, then to the east, then southward, and so to the west, around Boeotia. Seven contingents; 262 ships.   See p. viii. of the Vocabulary. </p><p>The poet begins with Boeotia, prob. because the fleet collected at Aulis (303). Because of this beginning, the ancients gave the name BoKoria or Bouorcoi to the Catalogue of the ships. </p><p>494^10. Boeotia, This document presents a distribution of the Greeks such as existed after the Trojan war. Acc. to Thuc. i. 12, the Boeotians lived in Thessaly until sixty years after the fall of Troy. See on 507. More towns are mentioned in Boeotia than elsewhere. This last fact may indicate not a Boeotian poet, but the extent of the culture and history of the country.

The maker has endeavored to be concise,\\xe2\\x80\\x94to give nothing but what is important for the accurate and appreciative reading of the poem, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and yet to show the original and derived meanings of the words, and to suggest translations which should be both simple and dignified. Much space has been saved by omitting the words and forms which are not found in the first six books of the Iliad. </p><p>A concise special vocabulary to the Homeric Poems, or to parts of them, is open to far fewer objections than a similar vocabulary to any other work of Greek literature, since the words are found more nearly in their original significations and constructions. Ko attempt has been made in this work to tell the history of each word in pre-Hellenic and post-Homeric times. Even the most complete Homeric dictionary cannot entirely supersede the large general lexicons, but a confident hope is felt that the concise form of this vocabulary will save much time for the beginner in Homer. The beginner meets many unusual words. Whether he uses a large or a small dictionary, he will be satisfied, in most cases, with learning the meaning and construction of the new word; and generally this is enough for him. The teachers who insist on the use of the unabridged lexicon of Liddell and Scott by elementary classes in Homer forget the word of Hesiod, ovS* IxraxTiv oa-i^ irXiov yfuxrv iravros, while this vocabulary will give fuller and better information about Homeric words and forms than the abridged edition of Liddell and Scott\\'s lexicon.

Mr. W.

For Introduetloii, $1.00. </p><p>^HE book is in two parts, Syntax of Verbs and Syntax ot w Nouns, with a brief introduction on Arrangement, and the Uses of Prepositions, Conjunctions, and Particles. It is designed for preparatory schools and for early courses in college. </p><p>After the example of recent German works, the exercises are a series of episodes following the narrative of Xenophon\\'s Anabasis through the seven books, to which are added similar exercises based on passages from six books of the Hellenica. The exercises are not translations from the text, but the text furnishes the theme and most of the words and phrases, to which, however, other words or expressions belonging to Xenophon\\'s diction are added. </p><p>The book offers thus a somewhat wide range in its subject-matter and vocabulary, while preserving unity in both, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 based as it is, upon the acknowledged standard of Attic prose. </p><p>A feature of the work is a copious English-Greek vocabulary in which the accompanying constructions are in most cases indicated. It is believed that this will do much to promote accuracy, save time, and facilitate labor on the part of the student. </p><p>A grammar lesson on the chief constructions to be used is prefixed to each exercise, and other grammar references are given in the notes and the vocabulary. </p><p>For those who desire a shorter course, twenty lessons are indicated which include all the regular constructions of Verbs and Nouns. The book is designed, however, to furnish material by which the teacher can extend and vary his course according to special aims and needs. Full indexes of the subject-matter and of the syntactical constructions presented are provided. The sentences, while avoiding involved and difficult constructions, are yet long enough to admit of some attention to connection, symmetry, and other elements of style. </p><p>In brief, the special features offered are : </p><p>(1) A comprehensive scheme of grammatical study ; </p><p>(2) Variety and unity in the subject-matter of the exercises ; </p><p>(3) A copious English-Greek vocabulary. </p><p>aiNN a COMPANY, Publisher, </p><p>Boitoa, New York, and Chicago. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"379\" id=\"379\"/><p>ANABASIS An illustrated Dictionary to Xenophon\\'t </p><p>_ A T^%7 Anabasis, with Groups of words </p><p>Die riON AKY etymologically r\\xc2\\xabUted. </p><p>By </p><p>JOHN WILLIAMS WHITE, Professor of Greek, and MORRIS H.

Cloth. sg3+62 pag^es. lUuttrated. For introductioB, $1.95. </p><p>The lessons in this book have been graded with great care. Each new lesson is built upon the preceding lessons. The author has aimed at a systematic development of the subject, following an even and regular gradation from the simpler to the more difficult and complex lessons. Each lesson consists, by the rule, of a statement of grammatical principles, a vocabulary, exercises, and reading lesson. The principle has been to give only such fundamental facts of grammar as the student must know before he can begin to read the connected narrative of Xenophon intelligently and with pleasure. </p><p>The average number of words in each lesson is only ten. Only those words have been given which are really important. By the rule they are words that occur frequently in the first eight chapters of the Anabasis, or words that occur eight times or more in the whole of the Anabasis. All the information about the word that the pupil needs at this stage of his progress is given in the special vocabulary. </p><p>A set of brief rules of syntax with illustrative examples is given, to which references are made in the body of the book. </p><p>Only those principles of syntax are developed which are so peculiar to Greek as to be really difficult. In the body of the book no stress is laid on the development of the syntax of any other part of speech than that of the verb. In the general vocabularies the aim is to give full information. Particular attention is called to the Greek-English vocabulary. </p><p>The book is very fully illustrated, but not primarily for the sake of embellishment. A great deal of study was devoted to this part of the work. The pictures are constantly referred to in the vocabularies. These have been selected from the best sources. </p><p>B. L.

Half morocco. Ixv + 478 +194 pages. Illustrated. For introduction, $1.40. </p><p>This new edition of Cicero has been treated with special reference to the use of the orations as models of classic oratory. The Introduction is made to help in this study of applied logic and rhetoric. There is a full life of Cicero, describing his education and development as an orator, as well as his political career. There is a chapter connecting the style of the orations with ancient formal rhetoric. There is also a chapter on Roman oratory and the place of the orator in ancient civilization. </p><p>The text includes the following orations: The Manilian Law, four orations against Catiline, Archias, Milo, Marcellus, Ligarius, the fourteenth Philippic, and copious extracts from the Defence of Roscius and the Actio Secunda against Verres. </p><p>Almost everything admitting of graphic presentation has an illustration, and no little study has been expended in finding the most suitable pictures. Views of places, scenes of Roman life, and portraits have been specially sought. Many coins are shown. The illustrations are fully explained in the Index, with criticisms. </p><p>J. H. Weetcott, Professor of Latin, Princeton University^ Princeton^ N.J.: I shall recommend the use of it in the Princeton Preparatory School. </p><p>Prank Smalley, Professor of Latin, Syracuse University ^ Syracuse, N.

A special aim of the introduction and notes is to introduce the student to a literary study of Virgil and so open the way to a fruitful reading of the classic authors generally. The learner is skilfully introduced to scansion. Full information and practical directions are given, and, in particular, English prosody is made the gate to Latin prosody. </p><p>The notes have been faithfully revised. The grammatical references have been made to fit the latest editions of the grammars. </p><p>A special feature of the notes is the attempt to illustrate by quotations from a wide range of English poets. Virgil, thus studied, should become a most valuable aid in the general literary culture of the pupil. </p><p>Close and discriminating care has been given to the illustrations. Facsimile reproduction has been largely employed in this edition as the only satisfactory process. Fine engravings on wood have been presented where the subject allowed, and the pictures as a whole are believed to possess remarkable power and beauty as well as illustrative value. </p><p>B. P. Crowell, Professor of Latin, A ntherst College, A mhersty Mass.: Worthy of being heartily commended to every teacher and student of Virgil. </p><p>W. B.

The book contains connected passages based on each chapter of the first four books of Caesar, and on six orations of Cicero; there are also supplementary exercises for sight tests. </p><p>While the words, idioms, and constructions required in translating into Latin may all be found in the text, the author has avoided the mistake of merely putting together parts of different sentences, taken from the text unchanged, which the pupil may hunt up and put together without knowing the construction of the sentence. </p><p>The exercises have been carefully constructed so as to preserve the narrative, style, and spirit of the original. The utmost care has been taken to lead the pupil to observe, appreciate, and use the proper con^ junctions and pronouns which mark the transitions from one sentence to another in Latin. </p><p>It has been the constant aim of the author to lead the pupil to acquire a working knowledge of grammar, so that he may rely more upon himself and less upon the teacher. Instead of telling the pupil, for instance, whether to use the subjunctive or infinitive, reference has been made to the grammar to the principle involved, so that the pupil learns his grammar as he needs it, and applies it as he learns it. </p><p>The plan has been adopted of giving numerous cross-references, to foster the habit of comparing various passages in which a given construction, or idiom, occurs, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a practice invaluable to the student at every stage df his progress. </p><p>GINN &amp; COMPANY, Publishers, Boston, New York, and Chicaio. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"385\" id=\"385\"/><p>THE FIRST LATIN BOOK </p><p>By W.

This has always been regarded as the truest and soundest of Latin grammar manuals. Instead of making arbitrary laws and distinctions in order to secure an artificial clearness of statement, this grammar has been faithful to the spirit and the facts of the language. This is its fundamental excellence. The grammar explains the language instead of trying to make the language bear out the grammar. </p><p>Second. The present edition is as strong in class-room availability as it is for linguistic truth. George L. Kittredge, Professor of English at Harvard, was associate reviser, and largely on account of his combining special qualifications in Latin and in English, the style of the grammar was radically improved. It is believed to be now much clearer, more crisp and definite, more interesting and leamable, than any other grammar. </p><p>Third. Even in all the little points, the closest care was taken in the revision, and scarcely a book can be found in which the excellence is so uniform and in which the finish reaches so faithfully to the minutest details. </p><p>Fourth.

Worsley, MM.A. Oxon., Classical Masters in Edinburgh Academy. </p><p>This Atlas also contains Allen\\'s Geography of the Ancient World, which is designed to bring the leading epochs and events of ancient history into connection with the geography of the ancient world. Brief suggestions to teachers are added, to assist in the work of the class-room. </p><p>Spectator: It has the special attraction of Mr. Gladstone\\'s cooperation, who not only placed at the editor\\'s disposal the illustrations to his work on Homer, but enhanced the favor by revising the proof-sheets of the plates and text, as adapted for this Atlas. </p><p>Tracy Peck, Professor of Latin, Yale University: I have heretofore known the Atlas sufficiently well to feel justified in recommending it to inquiring students. </p><p>W. W. Goodwin, Professor of Greek, Harvard University: It is a most beautiful and highly useful work, and I am glad to see what used to be an expensive luxury brought within the means of all students of the classics. </p><p>S. R. Win&amp;ns, Professor of Greek, College of New fersey: It is superb: nothing to criticise, and everything to commend. Every student of the classics needs something of the sort, and this is by all odds the best of its kind. </p><p>QINN &amp; COMPANY, Publishers, </p><p>Boston. New York. Chicago. Atlanta.

The Homeric Poems are the oldest remains of Greek literature, but they were not the earliest poems of the Greeks. Lyric poetry naturally precedes epic poetry. Every nation has love songs, war songs, and dirges, before it has narrative poems. Those early songs of the Greeks are all lost, although traces of them are found in the Iliad and Odyssey, Doubtless the Greeks had also many brief songs, narrating exploits in war and hair-breadth \\'scapes in adventure, before any one thought of composing a long epic poem. In the Iliad and Odyssey are found indications of poems about the adventures of Heracles, of the Argonautic Expedition for the Golden Fleece, and of short songs about the expedition against Troy. The earlier and shorter epic poems were used freely by Homer (for this name may fairly be given to the man who formed the plan of the Iliad, and to whom its unity is due) in the composition of the Iliad, and again, after him, additions were made by other bards. The Iliad thus contains Pre-Homeric, Homeric, and PostHomeric elements. Some scholars lay more stress on the one class of elements, while other scholars lay more stress on another. But the lover of the poem, who reads it attentively again and again, generally feels the essential unity and harmony of the work more forcibly than the inconsistencies and discrepancies on which have been based the arguments for the different authorship of different parts of the poem. Composed at a time when the art of writing was not familiar to the people, when Greece had no * reading public,\\' the poem was made to be recited and heard, not to be read. It would, then, be composed in parts which could be recited at one sitting. The poet would not be solicitous to preserve exact harmony of detail between lays which were not likely to be sung in immediate succession nor on the same occasion. He would not begin his work with the plan of composing a poem of 15,000 verses, but, finding that his theme was popular and admitted of indefinite expansion, he would naturally develop what had been only indicated before. Thus the Books of the Iliad doubtless were not composed in the order in which they stand in our texts. The first part of the First Book must have been the earliest composed, for that is the basis of the rest of the poem; but Books II.-VI. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"9\" id=\"9\"/><p>vi INTRODUCTION. \\xc2\\xa7 2. </p><p>(and still more, Books VII.-X.) may have been composed after Book XI., in order to fill up the details of the story. </p><p>The beginner need not (and should not) be disturbed by questions as to the diverse authorship of different parts of the Iliad, The subject is exceedingly complicated, and cannot be studied profitably until the student is perfectly familiar with the entire poem, and with similar literature in other languages. The student should strive to enjoy and appreciate the Homeric Poems, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not to analyze them.* </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 2. a. Scholars now do not ask where Homer was bom, but rather where Greek epic poetry had its rise. The Muses were * Pierian Muses,* \\'OXvfiiria S^/mr \\xe2\\x82\\xacxoviT\\xe2\\x82\\xacU, and their earliest home seems to have been on the slopes of Mt. Olympus, in Pierian Thessaly. Thence epic poetry was carried by the Aeolians to Asia Minor, where it was adopted and perfected by the lonians. The Homeric Poems still contain many Aeolic forms in words and phrases for which the lonians had no metrical equivalent. </p><p>b. No one can tell the exact date of the composition of the Homeric Poems. Probably they were essentially in their present form as early as the Eighth Century b.c. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 3. a. An Epic Poem is a narration in heroic verse of a dignified story of considerable length which has a definite beginning, middle, and end, and an organic relation of parts. The time of the action should not be so long as to make difficult a general view of the story. The poet puts as much as possible of his tale into the mouth of his actors, and so the Iliad is strongly dramatic. In the First Book, the first 427 verses are almost entirely dramatic, the narrative serving simply as * stage directions.*  Epic poetry was the mother of the drama. </p><p>* The famous Homeric Question, as to the composition of the Homeric Poems, was first treated in a scientific way by a German scholar, Friedrich August Wolf, in his Prolegomena ad Homerum, 1795. He claimed that the Iliad and the Odyssey were not the work of one poet, and that the unity of each poem was given to it by scholars at the court of Pisistratus in Athens, in the Sixth Century B.C. He based his view on external arguments, which have grown weaker rather than stronger since his day, and are almost entirely neglected now. About half a century later, in 1837, another German scholar, Lachmann, divided the Iliad into sixteen different lays, resting his division on internal arguments, t.e., on the inconsistencies of different parts. The discussion now continues, with the use of internal arguments, but scholars are less inclined than a few years ago to suppose that the Iliad is a conglomeration of separate lays, a \\' fortuitous concurrence of atoms,\\' and are more disposed to favor the idea of a natural and organic development, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 such as was suggested for the Odyssey by Eircbhoff in 1859. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"10\" id=\"10\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa74b. EPIC POETRY. rii </p><p>b. The Homeric Poems used to be compared with Vergil\\'s Aeneid, Dante\\'s Divina Commedia^ and Milton\\'s Paradise Lost. But men have come to see a difference between the Natural Epic and the Literary Epic. Vergil had no personal (only an artistic) interest in the battles and adventures of his hero. He sends Aeneas to Hades simply because the Homeric Odysseus had been there; he makes Aeneas tell the story of his wanderings and sufferings to Queen Dido, because Odysseus had told a similar story to King Alcinous. Vergil consciously strives to unite the characteristics of both Iliad and Odyssey, and begins his poem with arma virumque cano, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the arma being for the Iliad and the virum for the Odyssey. Vergil is self-conscious, too, in the use of cano, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he remembers that he is the court poet of Augustus, and borrows the word * sing,* although his poem was not meant to be sung but to be read.   But Homer is in earnest when he says, aetSc tfca, Sing, goddess! </p><p>In the Epics of Vergil, Dante, and Milton, more grace and finish are expected, and more studied thought. * The capital distinction of Homeric poetry,\\' as Professor Jebb has well said, *is that it has all the freshness and simplicity of a primitive age, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all the charm which we associate with the \" childhood of the world \"; while on the other hand it has completely surmounted the rudeness of form, the struggle of thought with language, the tendency to grotesque or ignoble modes of speech, the incapacity for equable maintenance of a high level, which belong to the primitive stage of literature.\\' </p><p>c. A great Natural Epic is possible only in a nation which has a rich and varied mythology. Hence, the Romans, being without a mythology of their own, could have no great Natural Epic. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 4. a. Homer\\'s story of the Siege of Troy certainly was not intended as a history of an actual occurrence. The poet says again and again that he is of a later generation. He asks the Muse to tell the story, since she alone knows what really happened. Doubtless many such battles were fought and many such sieges endured in Asia Minor about 1000 years b.c. </p><p>b. Dr. Heinrich Schliemann was led by his Homeric enthusiasm, a few years ago, to excavate the site of Hissarlik (\\'Ilium Novum\\') in the Troad, near the Hellespont, and that of Mycenae in Argolis. In both places he found indications and remains of ancient wealth and power which justified the Homeric epithets of Ilios and Mycenae, and made more probable the belief that the story of the expedition against Troy was founded on fact. Mycenae may have been the chief city of Peloponnesus, at one time. An armada may have been led by the King of Mycenae against Troy. But certainly most of the incidents and names of heroes were invented. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"11\" id=\"11\"/><p>viii </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 5. a. HOMERIC LIFE. The Homeric Poems give a picture of life in Greece which differs in important particulars from that of the classical or historical period. The poet knows no one name for Greece as opposed to other lands. The Greeks are * Argives,* * Achaeans/ or * Danaans.\\' The * Hellenes\\' are as yet only the inhabitants of a small district in Thessaly. The names of \\' Attica\\' and\\' Peloponnesus\\' are unheard. Thebes seems to be in ruins. Athens has no special distinction. Menelaus, king of Sparta, and his country are comparatively insignificant, although the war was undertaken to avenge the wrong which he had suffered from Paris. The brother of Menelaus, Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, is the chief monarch of Greece. The Greek colonies and the Greek cities of Asia Minor are not mentioned. Monarchy prevails; democracies seem to be unknown. The king is also commander-in-chief of the army, judge, and priest. As head of the nation he represents it before the gods, but his power is practically limited. Public opinion is strong, although Homer has no word for law. </p><p>b. Monarchy prevails among the gods as among men. Zeus (* Jupiter\\') is mightier than all the rest together. Athena (\\'Minerva\\') and Apollo are next to Zeus in power. Athena is the chief divinity of war. Ares (* Mars\\') is comparatively insignificant. Dionysus (* Bacchus\\') is not as yet admitted to the circle of gods on Olympus. Asclepius (&lt; Aesculapius \\') is still a mortal. Pan and the Satyrs are unknown. The gift of prophecy is granted to individual men. The oracle of Delphi is hardly mentioned.   Temples are uncommon. </p><p>c. The Homeric knights do not ride on horseback, but fight from chariots. They roast their meat, and do not boil it. They sit at table, and do not recline at dinner. They buy their wives by large gifts of cattle to the parents. The most useful metal is copper or bronze; iron is little used. Coined money is unknown; all trade is barter. The occupations of the rich and poor differ little. Princes tend flocks and build houses; princesses fetch water and wash clothes. The heroes are their own butchers and cooks. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 6. THE STORY OF THE ILIAD, a. The action of the Iliad itself covers only a few days, but many allusions are made to preceding events which complete the story, </p><p>Paris (whose Greek name was Alexander), son of King Priam of Troy (or Bios) on the shore of the Hellespont, on the northwest comer of Asia Minor, carries away Helen, wife of King Menelaus of Sparta. The Achaeans (Greeks) unite to avenge the wrong, under command of Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, the brother of Menelaus. Nestor and Odysseus visit Thessaly and enlist Achilles (son of Peleus and the sea^goddess </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"12\" id=\"12\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa77 a. THE STORY OF THE ILIAD. ix </p><p>Xhetis) and his friend Patroclus. The Greeks assemble at Aulis. There a portent is seen, which the seer Calchas interprets to mean that they shall fight for nine years around Troy, and capture the city in the tenth year. On their way to Troy, they stop at the island of Lemnos, where they are hospitably entertained, and where they leave one of their chieftains, Philoctetes, who has been bitten by a water-snake. On their arrival at Troy, Menelaus and Odysseus go to the city as ambassadors, and demand the return of Helen, which is refused. Some of the Trojans even urge that the ambassadors be put to death, but their host Antenor and others secure their safety. The Achaeans begin the siege. The Trojans send to their neighbors and gain allies. </p><p>b. The siege is not very close. The Greek camp is at a considerable distance from the city, and the Greeks cannot devote all of their time to fighting. They are obliged to make expeditions against the neighboring towns in order to obtain supplies. In these marauding forays, the men of the sacked towns are killed or sent to other countries to be sold as slaves; the women are often brought to the Greek camp before Troy. Meanwhile, the wealth of the city of Troy is nearly exhausted. The Trojans have been obliged to pay and support their allies, and have been shut out from the use of their fields. Th^y are afraid to meet the Greeks in open battle. </p><p>c. Of the gods, Hera (* Juno\\'), Athena, and Poseidon (* Neptune *) favor the Achaeans; Aphrodite (* VenusAres, and Apollo favor the Trojans. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 7. a. The Iliad begins in the midst of the tenth year of the war. Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo, had been captured on one of the marauding expeditions of the Achaeans, and was given to Agamemnon as the * first-fruit\\' of the spoils. The captive\\'s aged father comes to the Greek camp, bearing the fillets of Apollo as his official insignia, and begs to be allowed to ransom his daughter, but Agamemnon sends him away, slighting his request. As he leaves the Greek camp, the old priest prays for vengeance to his god, Apollo, who hears his prayer and sends pestilence upon the Achaeans. For nine days the plague rages in the camp, but on the tenth day an assembly is called by Achilles, who urges that some seer be questioned of the cause of the god\\'s anger. The old seer Calchas tells the truth. Achilles reproaches Agamemnon, and the two heroes quarrel. At last Agamemnon sends Chryseis home to her father, but takes from Achilles his prize of honor, Brise\\'is. Achilles begs his mother, the sea-goddess Thetis, to invoke the aid of Zeus, praying that victory may be granted unto the Trojans until the Achaeans learn to value and honor her son\\'s might. This prayer is reluctantly granted by Zeuay and the First Book closes with a half-ludicrous scene on Olympus. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"13\" id=\"13\"/><p>X </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>b. At the opening of the Second Book, Zens sends to Agamemnon a delusive dream, bidding him to arm the Achaeans for battle, with all haste. After a council of the elders, Agamemnon tries the temper of the soldiers by proposing to return at once to their homes. To his grief, the men accede enthusiastically and begin immediately the preparations for the voyage. They are stopped by Odysseus, who acts imder the direction of Athena. A second assembly is held, the Greeks are shamed and awed into remaining, and they prepare for battle. As the Achaean army advances against Troy, the poet gives a muster of the forces, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the * Catalogue of the Ships,\\' \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which is followed by a less elaborate enumeration of the Trojans and their allies. </p><p>c. At the beginning of the Third Book, the opposing armies are about to meet, when Paris challenges Menelaus to a single combat which shall decide the war. The two husbands of Helen, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the wronged Menelaus and the offending Paris, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 are the fit champions of the two armies. This scene would naturally belong to the first year of the war; but as the poet begins his story in the tenth year of the war, the best that he can do is to make this combat the beginning of the conflicts which he describes. Priam is called from Troy, and a truce is struck. K Menelaus slays Paris, the Greeks are to take Helen and peaceably return to their homes. If Paris slays Menelaus, the Greeks are to withdraw at once. Menelaus disables Paris and has him in his power, when Aphrodite snatches up her Trojan favorite, and deposits him safely in his home. </p><p>d. The terms of the truce have not been fulfilled. Neither combatant has been slain, but the victory fairly belongs to the Greeks. In order that the Trojans may not surrender Helen, and preserve their city, Athena (who hates Troy) descends a third time to the field of war, and incites a Trojan ally to send an arrow at Menelaus. The Greek hero is wounded, and the Greeks, indignant at this treacherous breach of the truce, prepare at once for the battle, and advance upon the enemy, near the close of the Fourth Book. </p><p>e.

The Greeks spend another day in building a wall about their camp, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a wall which was not needed as long as Achilles was fighting on their side, but which is necessary now that the Trojans are ready to assume the offensive, </p><p>h. The Eighth Book tells of a brief day of battle, in which the fortunes of war are continually changing, and in which Zeus continually interferes. At the close of this Book, the Achaeans are driven into their camp, and welcome the approach of night which affords them relief from pursuit and attack. The Trojans bivouac upon the plain and are confident of annihilating their enemies on the morrow. </p><p>i. On the night following the battle of the Eighth Book, the Greek leaders send to Achilles an embassy, offering him rich gifts, and begging him to return to the battle, but he stoutly refuses. The account of this embassy fills the Ninth Book. </p><p>j. The Tenth Book narrates the visit (on that same night) of Odysseus and Diomed to the Trojan camp, where they slay Rhesus, the Thracian leader, who had just arrived at the field of action. </p><p>k. With the Eleventh Book begins the third of the four days of battle of the Iliads \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a day which does not close until the end of the Eighteenth Book. Agamemnon distinguishes himself now more than on any other occasion, but retires from the field wounded, and is followed by Diomed and Odysseus who are also disabled. The Trojans press forward to the Greek wall, and at the close of the Twelfth Book, Hector breaks down the great gates, and opens a way for his comrades into the Greek camp. </p><p>1. At the opening of the Thirteenth Book, Poseidon comes from the sea in order to aid the Greeks. Hera distracts the attention of Zeus while Poseidon and the Achaeans put the Trojans to rout. </p><p>m. At the opening of the Fifteenth Book, Zeus notices what is done on the Trojan plain, and sends Poseidon back to his home in the sea. The Trojans press forward again and reach the Greek ships, and Hector calls for fire that he may burn the fleet. </p><p>n. At the opening of the Sixteenth Book, Patroclus begs Achilles to allow him to take the Myrmidons and enter the battle. Achilles sees the flicker of fire among the ships; he consents, and gives his friend his own armor to wear, but directs him to be satisfied with driving the enemy from the camp, and not to attempt the capture of Troy. Patroclus, however, becomes excited by the fray, and follows the Trojans to the very gate of the city.   There he is slain by Apollo and Hector. </p><p>o. Most of the Seventeenth Book is devoted to the battle around the body of Patroclus.  Hector strips off the armor, but the Achaeans with </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"15\" id=\"15\"/><p>xii </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa77 p. </p><p>great difficulty secure the corpse and carry it back to the camp, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 hard pressed by the enemy. </p><p>p. In the Eighteenth Book, Achilles learns with overwhelming grief of the death of his comrade. His mother Thetis comes from the sea to comfort him. His armor is in the hands of Hector, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 stripped from the body of Fatroclus. He cannot enter the combat, but he appears unarmed at the trench, and frightens away the Trojans. His mother goes to Olympus to beg for him beautiful armor from Hephaestus (\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Vulcan *). Here ends the third day of battle, which began with the opening of the Eleventh Book. </p><p>q. In the Nineteenth Book, Achilles is reconciled to Agamemnon. His hatred for Hector and his desire for vengeance on the slayer of Fatroclus more than overbalance his more ancient grudge. The fourth day of the battles of the Iliad begins. The gods descend to take part in the battle, but do not affect its issue. </p><p>r. On the opening of the Twenty-second Book, all the Trojans but Hector are either slain or within the walls of the city. But Hector does not yield to the entreaties of his father and mother, who, from the wall, pray him to return. He awaits Achilles and is slain. His body is dragged to the camp, after the chariot of Achilles. </p><p>s. The Twenty-third Book is devoted to the burial of Fatroclus, and the funeral games in his honor. </p><p>t. In the Twenty-fourth Book, the aged Friam, under the care of the gods, goes to the Achaean camp and obtains from Achilles the body of his son Hector.

AFTER THE ILIAD. xiii </p><p>This scheme shows that the action of the lUad covers but seven weeks. Three of these are occupied by the action of the first book, and three by that of the last two books; only four days are spent in fighting. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 9. The Story after the Action of the Iliad. For part of the last act in the siege of Troy, indications exist in the Iliad and Odyssey. Many other details were added by later poets. </p><p>a. After the death of Hector, the Amazons come to the help of the Trojans. Their queen is slain by Achilles. Memnon, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a cousin of Hector, \\xe2\\x80\\x94the beautiful son of Eos (Dawn) and Tithonus, comes with his Aethiopians. He slays Nestor\\'s son Antilochus, a dear friend of Achilles, but is then himself slain by the mighty son of Thetis. Achilles is overcome by Apollo and Paris, as he is about to force an entrance to the city through the Scaean Gate. His mother comes from the sea, with her sister Nereids, and bewails him. She offers his beautiful armor as a prize to the bravest of the Greeks, and it is awarded to Odysseus. Telamonian Ajax goes mad in his disappointment at not receiving the armor, and commits suicide. Paris is slain, and Helen becomes the wife of his brother Deiphobus. Philoctetes, the bearer of the bow of Heracles, is brought from Lemnos where he had been left (\\xc2\\xa7 6, B 721 ff.); and Neoptolemus, the young son of Achilles, is brought from the island of Scyrus. Odysseus enters the city of Troy as a spy, in the guise of a beggar. Athena suggests to Odysseus the building of the * wooden horse,\\' in which the bravest of the Achaeans are hidden, while the rest set fire to their camp and sail away. The Trojans drag the wooden horse within the city, and at night the Greeks return and Troy is sacked. </p><p>b. Agamemnon reaches home in safety, but is treacherously murdered by his wife and her paramour, Aegisthus. Menelaus is driven from his course by a storm. Most of his ships are wrecked on the coast of Crete. He himself, with Helen, is carried by the wind to Aegypt, and wanders for eight years before his return to his home at Sparta. </p><p>c. Nestor, Diomed, and Idomeneus reach home safely. Ajax, the son of O\\'ileus, is wrecked and drowned. </p><p>d. Odysseus is driven by the storm to the land of the Lotus Eaters, thence to the island of Polyphemus (i), thence to the island of Aeolus, to the land of the Laestrygonians (where eleven of his twelve ships are destroyed), and to the island of Circe where he and his companions remain during a year (#c). Then they go to Hades (X) to consult the old seer Teiresias. On their return they pass Scylla and Charybdis, they come to the island of the Sun, and (urged by hunger) kill one of his cows. They are punished by shipwreck, from which Odysseus alone escapes. He is borne to the island of Calypso (/a), where he remains for eight years. Then </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"17\" id=\"17\"/><p>xiv INTRODUCTION. f la </p><p>he returns to his home on Ithaca, enduring many sufferings on the way. He finds his faithful wife, Penelope, surrounded by more than a hundred young and insolent suitors.   These he kills, and regains his kingdom. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 10. The division of the Iliad and Odyssey, each into twenty-four books, was not made by the poet himself, nor was it known in the classical period. It seems to have been made by the scholars of Alexandria about 250 years B.C. The \\'books\\' were lettered not numbered. The large letters of the Greek alphabet (A, B, F, jcrX.) are used to indicate the books of the Iliad; the small letters (a, ^, y, icr\\\\.) are used for the books of the Odyssey. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 11. HOMERIC STYLE, a. Matthew Arnold enumerates four essential characteristics of Homer\\'s poetry: * Homer is rapid in his movement, Homer is plain in his words and style, Homer is simple in his ideas, Homer is noble in his manner. Cowper renders him ill because he is slow in his movement and elaborate in his style; Pope renders him ill because he is artificial both in his style and in his words; Chapman renders him ill because he is fantastic in his ideas.\\' </p><p>If poets and masters have thus failed, clearly it is no easy achievement to translate Homer well, to be at the same time rapid, plain, simple, and noble, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 aS irtos ofm irdvra Swi/o-ctu avros cXccr^. The beginner can at least be simple; he should aim to attain the other qualities also. </p><p>b. Pope says in his preface: * That which in my opinion ought to be the endeavour of any one who translates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character. In particular places, where the sense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as most agreeing with that character. To copy him in all the variations of his style and the different modulations of his numbers. To preserve in the more active or more descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the more sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a fulness and perspicuity; in the sentences [sententiaej^, a shortness and gravity. Not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor sometimes the very cast of the periods. Neither to omit or confound any rites or customs of antiquity. ... To consider him attentively in comparison with Vergil above all the ancients, and with Milton above all the moderns.\\' </p><p>*The story of the Iliad is the Anger of Achilles, the most short and single subject that was ever chosen by any poet. Yet this he has supplied with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and episodes of all kinds than are to be found even in those poems, whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity. The action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole dursLtion occupies not so much as fifty </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"18\" id=\"18\"/><p>HOMERIC STYLE. </p><p>XV </p><p>days. Vergil, for want of so warm a genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer\\'s poems into one which is but a fourth part as large as his.\\' Pope, Translation of Homer, </p><p>c. Cowper says in his preface: \\' My chief boast is that I have adhered closely to the original, convinced that every departure from him would be punished with the forfeiture of some grace or beauty for which I could offer no substitute. ... It has been my point eveiywhere to be as little verbose as possible. ... In the affair of style, I have endeavoured neither to creep nor to bluster, for no author is so likely to betray his translator into both these faults as Homer, though himself never guilty of either. . . . The passages which will be least noticed . . . are those which have cost me abundantly the most labour. It is difficult to kill a sheep with dignity in a modern language, to flay and to prepare it for the table, detailing every circumstance of the process. Difficult also, without sinking below the level of poetry, to harness mules to a wagon, particularizing every article of their furniture, straps, rings, staples, and even the tying of the knots that kept all together. Homer, who writes always to the-eye, with all his sublimity and grandeur, has the minuteness of a Flemish painter.\\' Cowper, Translation of the Iliad. </p><p>d. Two passages from the great German critic, Lessing, are worthy to be remembered in this connection: \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The picture of the plague. What do we see on the canvas? Dead bodies, the flame of funeral pyres, the dying busied with the dead, the angry god upon a cloud discharging his arrows. The profuse wealth of the picture becomes poverty in the poet. ... Now let us turn to Homer himself [A 44-53]. The poet here is as far beyond the painter as life is better than a picture. Wrathful, with bow and quiver, Apollo descends from the Olympian towers. I not only see him, but hear him. At every step the arrows rattle on the shoulders of the angry god. He enters among the host like the night. Now he seats himself over against the ships, and with a terrible clang of the silver bow sends his first shaft against the mules and dogs. Next he turns his poisoned [deadly] darts upon the warriors themselves, and unceasing blaze on every side the corpse-laden pyres. It is impossible to translate into any other language the musical painting heard in the poet\\'s words.\\'  Laocoon xiii. (Miss Frothingham\\'s translation.) </p><p>* When Homer wishes to tell us how Agamemnon was dressed, [B 42 ff.] he makes the king put on every article of raiment in our presence: the soft tunic, the great mantle, the beautiful sandals, and the sword. When he is thus fully equipped he grasps his sceptre. We see the clothes while the poet is describing the act of dressing.  An inferior writer would have </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"19\" id=\"19\"/><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>f 11 e. </p><p>described the clothes down to the minutest fringe, and of the action we should have seen nothing. . . . How does he manage when he desires to give a more full and minute picture [B 101 ff.] of the sceptre, which is here called only ancestral and undecaying, as a similar one in another place is only ^vcrioi^ rjXoun ireirap/ievov^i Does he paint for us, beside the golden nails, the wood, and the carved head? He might have done so had he been writing a description for a book of heraldry, from which at some later day an exact copy was to be made. Yet I have no doubt that many a modem poet would have given such heraldic description in the honest belief that he was really making a picture himself, because he was giving the painter material for one. But what does Homer care how far he outstrips the painter? Instead of a copy, he gives us the history of the sceptre. First we see it in the workshop of Vulcan; then it shines in the hands of Jupiter; now it betokens the dignity of Mercury; now it is the baton of warlike Felops; and, again, the shepherd\\'s staff of peaceloving Atreus. . . . And so at last I know this sceptre better than if a painter should put it before my eyes, or a second Vulcan give it into my hands.\\'  Laocoon xvi. </p><p>e. Direct Discourse, Like the writers of Holy Scripture, and as in the simple style of ballads and fairy tales and the conversation of children and uneducated persons, the Homeric poet avoids the use of indirect discourse; he has no long passages in oratio obliqua, in the manner of the reported speeches in Caesar\\'s Commentaries. He passes quickly from indirect to direct discourse. Contrast 6 yap ^XOc &amp;oa^ ciri v^as \\'Axawov | . . icat XtaacTO Travra^ *A)(auns \\\\ \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 vfuv fiev Oeoi SoUv *OXv/x9r(a Btofwr ^Xovre^ I itcjrlpacLL Uptofwu} ttqAxv, cv K otKoS* Ikco^cu * | irat&amp;i ^ e/uuH XwroL T\\xe2\\x82\\xac &lt;f&gt;CKiijv TO. r airocva ^^adax, \\\\ d^ofjuevoi Ato5 vtdv, ktcqPoKov \\'AttoA.Xctfva A 12 ff. with its paraphrase which uses indirect discourse, iXBwv 6 Iep\\xe2\\x82\\xacV9 evx\\'^TO CKctW? fuv rovs Ocots Sovvol iXoyra^ rrp^ TpoCay avrovs autOrfvoL, r^v Sk Ovyaripa ot \\\\xxTca 8c{a/xei/ov9 airocva koL rov Bthv aJ&amp;fxrBhrra^ icrX. in Plato Rep. iii. 393 E. </p><p>f. Principal Clauses, Similar to this avoidance of indirect discourse is the poet\\'s frequent and ready transition from a subordinate to a principal clause, as 09 /xcya Travrcov | *ApyctW Kparia koJl 01 ircUBovTOL *A)((UOl A 78 f. who rules with might over all the Argives and him (for whom) the Achaeans obey, ^ enrt ttoXXo. fjLoyrjo\\'a, Soa-av    /xot vie? *AxoMav A 162. </p><p>g. Thus the poet deserts the participial for a finite construction, as lourCv T\\xe2\\x82\\xac TiTva-KOfievoL AaeorcTi t* l^aXXov T 80, where ri. . ri mark the imperfect as correlative with the participle. </p><p>h. Order of Words. The simplicity of the Homeric order of words is most clearly seen by comparing a passage of Homer, with a similar pas</p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"20\" id=\"20\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa7 11 m. </p><p>HOMERIC STYLE. </p><p>xvii </p><p>sage of a later Greek poet or of Vergil. Many verses of the Iliad and Odyssey can be translated into English, word for word as they stand, as &lt;axo/JL\\xe2\\x82\\xacff cs ^riP-qv Uprjv woXiv *HcTtWos, | Trjv Sk St^irpajSofiev re koI rjyofjLCV \\xe2\\x82\\xacv$aj8e Travra, | . . cic ^ IXxjv \\'ArpeiSv; Xpv(n/6Sa KoXXnrdpyov icr\\\\. A 366 ff. When the order differs essentially from the English, there are generally rhetorical or poetical reasons why the order is what it is. No one should suppose that the metre compelled the poet to adopt an arrangement of words that was not natm*al and did not please him. The verse gave prominence not merely to the first word but often to the word before the principal caesural pause (\\xc2\\xa7 58). </p><p>i. The thought of each Homeric verse is somewhat more independent than is the case in later poetry. Other things being equal, a word should be construed with words in the same rather than in another verse. Rarely does a descriptive adjective at the close of one verse agree directly with a noun at the beginning of the next. </p><p>j. A noun at the close of one verse often has an adjective apparently in agreement with it at the beginning of the next verse, but this adjective may be regarded as in apposition with the noun; it frequently serves to form a closer connection with a following amplifying clause, as fjojviv aciSc Oea . . I mikoixhrqv fivpC *A;(a\\xc2\\xab)is &amp;X.y\\xe2\\x82\\xac* iOyKcv A 1 f., where the relative clause explains ovXofjJvrp^: the torath was mortal, deadly^ because it brought ten thousand woes upon the Achaeans. So a few verses later, vovaroy ava arparov (ap&lt;r\\xe2\\x82\\xac Kam/v, 6\\\\\\xe2\\x82\\xackovto 8c Xoot A 10, the position of the adjective Kojcqv is explained by its connection with the thought of the following clause. Cf. vvv avri fuv vies \\'A;(aMov | cv iraXjaifirf^ f^topiovtri StKocrTroXoi oi rc Oifiurra^ | irpb^ A109 etpmrat A 237 ff., where SiKaxriroXjoi is explained by the following clause, avrov thus often contrasts a man with his companions or possessions, as diro fUv &lt;f&gt;0&lt;a tlpara Sixrco | avrov 3c KXmovra Ooajs CTTi v^as d^crco B 261 ff. </p><p>k. The subject of the sentence usually precedes its verb. Almost every exception to this remark is found either at the close of the verse, or (less frequently) before the principal caesura where the same metrical freedom was allowed as at the end of the verse, \\xc2\\xa7 59 a 3. </p><p>1. In order to give prominence to an important word, it is sometimes placed before the relative word of the clause to which it belongs, as i7a&lt;i)rcpo9 cos \\xc2\\xab\\xe2\\x82\\xac vetfu A 32. This is especially frequent when the subordinate clause precedes the principal sentence, as ^Eicrcop 8* m ^Koias rc irvAas . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 iKavcv, | d/i^* dpa /uv . . Oiov ktX. Z 237. </p><p>m. Adnoininal genitives, like adjectives, generally precede their noun, except at the close of the verse or before a caesural pause, but there are many exceptions to the rule in the case of adjectives, principally perhaps </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"21\" id=\"21\"/><p>xviii </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>f lln. </p><p>where the adjective and substantive are closely connected. A preposition often stands between the adjective and noun, as ^vaiw dm atcqirrpij^ A 15, 6oas CTTi vrja^ A 12, ^luript^ m oiic&lt;p A 30, vrja^ hn yAa^vpas F 119. </p><p>n. The infinitive generally follows the verb on which it depends. </p><p>o. When a noun is modified by two adjectives, it frequently is preceded by one and followed by the other, as irapa vrfi fieXoLVQ A 300. So in English poetry &lt; human face divine,\\' * purest ray serene,\\' * old man eloquent.\\' </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 12. Epithets, a. Ornamental epithets frequently have reference to the most marked natural characteristics of an object rather than to a particular occasion. The ships are swift (Ooai) even when they are drawn up on land (A 300 and passim). The heaven is starry even in broad daylight, Z 108. Homer calls milk Xcvicov, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 of course, not to distinguish white milk from milk of another color, but to bring the object vividly before the mind by mentioning a quality of it which all would recognize as belonging to the nature of the object. The choice among these stereotyped conventional epithets was often determined by the convenience oi metre or rhythm (see \\xc2\\xa7 22 Z\\xc2\\xbb f.). </p><p>b. Almost every prominent person in the poems has some special epithet or epithets. Pope calls these * a sort of supernumerary pictures of the persons or things they are joined to. We see the motion of Hector\\'s plumes in the epithet KopvOalokK.* No one but Athena is yXavKwri^ and the adjective becomes virtually a proper name. She bears this epithet 90 times, generally in the phrase Oca yXavKutm^ \\'A^ny. She is HaXXas \\'A^ny 41 times. The Achaeans are ivianqfuSes \\'Axaiot 36 times, Kaprj KOfiowvreq 29 times, in the genitive \\'Axotcov x&lt;\\'^\\'(oxira)vci&gt;v 24 times, vle9 \\'Axoutfv 64 times, Aoos *Ax&lt;uSiv 22 times, KovpoL *Axauav 9 times. Agamemnon is &amp;va( dvSptov 45 times in the Iliad and thrice in the Odyssey, while this title is given to only five other chiefs, once to each. Achilles is TToSapKYi^ Sioq \\'Ax^AXevs 21 times, woSa^ toKv^ *A;(iXXcvs 30 times, wo^kco^ AIolklSoo 10 times, iro&amp;uKca UrjktLnwa 10 times. Hector is KopvOatoXjK 37 times, &lt;^\\'iSi/Ao$\\'\\'Efcrcop 30 times.   C/*. pius Aeneas, fidus Achates. </p><p>c. The situation of the moment seems sometimes to contradict the epithet, as rov i&amp;ov ptyiyo-e ^o^v dyajOo^ Aio/iiySi/s E 596 at sight of him Diomed good at the war cry shuddered. </p><p>d. Synonymous Expressions. The poet is fond of a cumulation of synonymous or nearly synonymous expressions, many of which remind the reader of redundant legal expressions, as &lt;^a&gt;n;ora9 irpooTfvSa A 201 lifted up his voice and addressed her, Ittos t c^mt Ik t ovofm^ev A 361 spoke a word and called upon him, ifiaj (oivros koi iirl xOovl BepKOfitvoio A 88, airptarrfv dvaTroivov A 99, rcov ov ri fUTarpeinj ovS* aXcyi^eiq A 160, </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"22\" id=\"22\"/><p>HOMERIC STYLB. </p><p>zix </p><p>iroXtfiJbi T\\xe2\\x82\\xac fidxajL re A177, iravraw fih Kparecw c^e\\\\ci irdvrtaat 8* dvaxraeiVy ] irSxn 8c ayf/mLV\\xe2\\x82\\xaciv A 288 f., ovr upofuu ovtc /leraXXSi A 553, o^ecu el k iOeXtfoda Kol a k\\xe2\\x82\\xaci/ tol ra fUfXT^ky A 353, \\xe2\\x80\\xa2^yyrope^ rjSk /xcSoktcs B 79. Sometimes the same stem is repeated for emphasis, in a different form, as oil/ifwv o^iriKeaTov B 325. </p><p>e. Epexegesis. A clause is often added epexegetically, to explain a preceding clause or word, as fx^viv . . ovXofjievrjv rj /ivpi* \\'A;(aiors SXye IOtjkcv a 1 f., rd T\\xe2\\x82\\xac Swp\\' *A&lt;^po&amp;Ti7s, | rj re KOfi-q to tc ciSos T 54 f. For explanatory asjmdeton, see \\xc2\\xa7 15 b. </p><p>f. The species often follows in apposition with the genus, as Kvfjuara fiOKpa BaXda-arj^ \\\\ irovrov *lKaploLo B 144 f., fimj^ \\\\ ravpoq B 480 f. Cf. the explanatory use of the infinitive, as epiSi ^werjKe yudx^odax A 8 brought together in strife, to contend. </p><p>g. Thus also the part of the mind or body which is employed or especially affected is mentioned, as ovk *Ayafi\\xe2\\x82\\xacfjjovL ijv&amp;ivc ^fjM A 24, X&lt;Do/i\\xc2\\xa3vo$ K^p A 44, KexpLpoiaTO Ovijm A 256, Iv 6&lt;l&gt;0aXfjjounv opSxrScu T 306. </p><p>h. Stereotyped Expressions, The same expressions recur under similar circumstances. We find a stereotyped description of a feast and of the preparations for it, of the breaking of day and of the approach of night, of doffing or donning sandals and armor; there are conventional expressions for setting out on a journey, for an attack in battle, for the fall and death of a warrior, for lying down to rest. Speeches are introduced and followed by set verses, as kcu /uv (or or^as) ^wnyaas iirea irrepoeyra irptxnju^ A 201, and in fifty other places; o cr^iv cv &lt;l&gt;poy\\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;ov dyofyrja-aro KCU /jicrcciTrev A 73 and in fourteen other places, while the second hemistich is found several times in other combinations; ^ rot o y &lt;Ss cittwv mr ap cfcTo, Totd-t S* dvcony A 68, 101, B 76. These stereotyped verses have been compared with the frequently recurring * And Job answered and said,\\' * Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,\\' of the book of Job, and with the set form in which the reports of the messengers were brought to the man of Uz, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 each of the four reports ending * and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.* </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 13. a. Parechesis, Onomatopoeia, etc. The poet seems to have looked with indifference on the similarity of sound in neighboring words. He does not appear to have designed the rhyme in iKiaOai, ^\\xe2\\x82\\xac\\\\\\xe2\\x82\\xac(t$cu A 19 f., SoKrct, dTroxrct A 96 f., ^(covaa, reKovora A 413 f., ipvaaav, rdwaa\\'av A 485 f., or between the two hemistichs of a verse, as Iottctc vvv fwi Movacu *0\\\\vpr TTia Sco/iar* cxovorot B 484. </p><p>Most exaniples of parechesis {iraprfxqo^si) and alliteration are probably accidental, as ttoXXcw Ik trokCmv B 131, h iroXjepav TrcoXi/o\\'ctu E 350, irarpL TC &lt;r&lt;f pAya injpa voXrji tc \\'jravri tc &amp;jpM V 50. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"23\" id=\"23\"/><p>XX </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa718 b. </p><p>b. Occasionally an onomatopoetic (oKopiroirotca), imitative expression is used, giving a kind of echo in the sound, as rpiyBa rc kcu rcrpaxOd r 363, of the breaking of the sword of Menelaus; cic 8c XpwrrfU 10709 ^rj irovTorjTopoio A 439, where a vivid imagination may perhaps hear the measured steps of the damsel as she leaves the ship, with a quick rush at the close; avri? hrtira ttcSovSc #cvXtv8ero XSm dvoi&amp;Js X 598, of the rolling back of the stone which Sisyphus in Hades was continually urging to the summit of a hill. </p><p>c. The poet plays occasionally on the names of his heroes, as TLpoOoo^ ^oos lyycfidvcvcv B 758 (\" swift by nature as well as by name \"), TXt/ttoXcyuov . . rkrjfiova Ovfwv Ix^^ ^^f^fop , . ttov artp Aacov trokiv \\xe2\\x82\\xac$\\xe2\\x82\\xacpjev E 472 f., whertf c^c/xcv seems to be selected with reference to the assumed etymology of ^EKTiop. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 14. a. Comparisons, A notable characteristic of Homeric style is the comparison. This is designed to throw into high relief some point in the action narrated; it often relieves the monotony of the description of a battle. But the poet is not always satisfied to illustrate the particular point for which the comparison is introduced; he often completes the picture by adding touches which have nothing to do with the narrative. </p><p>b. Illustrations are furnished by all experiences of life, from the lightning of Zeus and the conflict of opposing winds, from the snowstorm and the mountain torrent, to a child playing with the sand on the seashore, and a little girl clinging to her mother\\'s gown; from lions and eagles, to a stubborn ass which refuses to be driven from a cornfield by children, and to a greedy fly; from the evening star, to women wrangling in the street. The lion is a special favorite, and appears in comparisons thirty times in the Iliad. </p><p>c. Homer, like Milton, could not think of an army in motion without thinking of its resemblance to something else. Just before the Catalogue of the Ships, the movements of the Achaean armies are described by six detailed comparisons, B 455-483: the brightness of their armor is compared with the gleam of fire upon the mountains; their noisy tumult, with the clamor of cranes or swans on the Asian plain; in multitude, they are as the innumerable leaves and flowers of spring-time; they are impetuous and bold as the eager flies around the farm buildings; they are marshalled by their leaders as flocks of goats by their herds; their leader (Agamemnon) is like to Zeus, to Ares, to Poseidon, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he is preeminent among the heroes as a bull in a herd of cattle. </p><p>d. The Iliad has 182 detailed comparisons, 17 briefer (as Trcaalv Iolkorc9 riyopaaxrSt \\\\ Kiprtaxots 0I9 ov rt fie\\\\ct TroXe/uiiyta Ipya B 337 f.), and 28 </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"24\" id=\"24\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa716. </p><p>HOMERIC STYLE. </p><p>xxi </p><p>of the briefest sort. The Odyssey has 39 detailed comparisons, 6 briefer, and 13 very brief. The first book of the Iliad has only two comparisons, and those of the briefest, 6 S rju wktI cockcos A 47, -qvr ofux^V A 359. </p><p>e. Comparisons are introduced by q&gt;9 re, &lt;us ci,    ore, cSs irtp ktX. </p><p>Fraepositive W9 is not used in comparisons. In the briefest comparisons, postpositive m is often used, generally lengthening the preceding syllable (\\xc2\\xa7 59 j\\'). </p><p>f. The aorist indicative (the so-called &lt; gnomic aorist\\') is often used in comparisons. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 15. a. Asyndeton. In the Homeric period more frequently than in later Greek, sentences were left imconnected by conjunctions, i.e. asyndeton (H. 1039) was allowed more freely. Ornamental epithets are not connected by kcu, and sometimes in animated discourse the poet uses no conjunction between clauses or words, as dTrpian/v Avdiroivov A 99. </p><p>b. Asyndeton of sentences is most frequent where the second sentence explains the first and is in a kind of apposition with it, repeating the thought in a different form: oXAa koI m iB^hn So/uievtu ttoXiv ei rd y* aifieivcv\\' \\\\ PovXofi cyco Aaov aoov Ifjuitvax rj atrok\\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;rOai A 116 f., &amp; ttottoc, ^ /xeya ircvOo^ ^A^cuiSa yalav iKavei * | ^ kcv yyfdrj&amp;ax TLpCafjm TLpidfJuoio rc wat^q A 254 f., aXX avrjp c^eXei rrcpl travrtav ifijJievaJL oAAcov, | irdvTtav fjuev Kpariav c^cXci iravrccro-t S* dvocro-civ A 287 f. In B 299, tX^tc ^iAxm Kot fuivar hrl )(p6vov gives the sum of the preceding sentence, and the asyndeton marks the speaker\\'s warmth of feeling. </p><p>c. An adversative relation (biU) is occasionally expressed by an asyndeton, especially with ye fiev in the second clause, as B 703, E 516. </p><p>d. The absence of a conjunction often gives rapidity to the style and thus is found often where the second sentence begins with avrUa or at^a, as ei ^ aye /i^v iretfyrjaxu . . oT^d rot alfm KeXxavbv ipoyqa-a irepl Sovpi A 302 f., avTiKa KCprofuoun Ami Kpovicova trpoarfvSa A 539, cf. B 442. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 16. a. Chiasmus,^ For emphasis, the poet sometimes so arranges the words of two clauses that the extremes, as also the means, are cor</p><p>^ The name is given from the Greek letter X, there being a crossing of ideas as </p><p>ficuriKt^s &amp;ya665 KparepSs ^ alxfirrHis T 179. </p><p>It should be noticed that this chiastic arrangement is often the most simple and natural, as in the first example above, where &lt;roi at once suggests the other person interested, *o70os. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"25\" id=\"25\"/><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>i 16 b. </p><p>relative with or contrasted with each other, as mSd rc arot dycjficv* $oi)3a&gt; ff iepvpf ^Karofi^riy A 443, where muSa and hanofiPijy, aoC and ^P&lt;f respectively are contrasted.

Lost IV. 323 f. </p><p>b. Epanalepsis. Sometimes a word (generally a proper name) or a clause is repeated in the same sentence at the beginning of a new verse. Cf, Milton\\'s Lycidas 37 f. *But O the heavy change, now thou art gone, I Now thou art gone and never must retum.\\' The name is repeated at the beginning of three successive verses (Nt/9cvs . . Ntpcvs . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Ncpcvs) B 671 ff. Cf also B 838, 850, 871, Z 154. The name when repeated is attracted into the case of the following relative pronoun, in *AvSpo/iax&gt;7\\xc2\\xbb Ovyarrfp fLcyoXiyTO/jos \\'Hctouvos, | \\'HctiW emicv xnro TLXwaa vkrfiarfrg Z 395 f. Andromache, daughter of the greatsouled Eetion, Eetion who dwelt ai the foot of woody Placus. </p><p>c. Litotes (XiTOTTji or /ulwm), a simplicity of language, or understatement of the truth, is common to all languages. Milton\\'s \\' unblest feet\\' is stronger than cursed feet. Homeric examples abound, as ovk *Ayafi\\xe2\\x82\\xac/ivoyt \\xe2\\x80\\xa2^vSave $vfJM A 24: it was not pleasing to the soul of Agamemnon, i.e. it was hateful, etc.; &amp;^ cs kovXcov uktc /icya {t&lt;^$ ou8\\' aTriOrjaey \\\\ fivSta *AOrjvahfi A 220 f. hack into the sheath he thrust his great sword nor did he disobey the word of ^Athena, i.e. he obeyed; \\'\"EtKnap 8* ov ri OeSs liros yyvoirjaey B807. </p><p>d. a.

Later Change in Words* The student must be watchful to apprehend the exact Homeric meaning of words which are used in a slightly different sense in later Greek. Thus dyopi] and ayiav ai*e used in Homer of an assemhly, gathering, not of market and contest, *Kl&amp;q^ is always the name of a person, not of a place. doi&amp;&gt;9, doi^, are used for the Attic iroitjfrq^y v/iyo^, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 cttos is, used for koyoq, icoa/A\\xe2\\x82\\xaco&gt; for Toxram. Scivos means terrible, not skilful, Selnvov is the principal meal of the day, whenever it is taken, lyxos means spear, never sword, ijptai is used of all the warriors; it does not mean a hero in the English sense. Kpcm is select, discriminate, rather than judge, vocco often has the sense of aiaOdyofuu (which is not Homeric), /)erc\\xc2\\xabrtf. ovofuu is not blame in a general way, but think not enough, insufficient, ouro^co is wound unth a weapon held in the hand, not with a missile, irifiino is escort, attend, as well as send; cf. iro/uwny convoy, -toXc/aos is often battle rather than war. TTfyqcraui is carry through rather than (fo as in Attic. (r^cSoi^ is near, of place, not almost, awfjixi is used only of a dead body, Sc/xas being used of the living form, and avros and irepl xpdt taking some of the Attic uses of aw/xa. Toxa always means quickly, never perhaps as in later Greek. rlBrffU is often used like iroUio make. fl&gt;6po^ is not fright but flight; ffioPeofmi is not fear but flee.  &lt;us does not mean since. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 18. HOMERIC SYNTAX, a. In syntax as in forms, where the Homeric dialect differs from the Attic, it may be presumed that the Homeric usage is the earlier. The language was less rigid; custom had not yet established certain constructions as normal. There was greater freedom in the use of the modes and the cases, of prepositions and conjunctions. </p><p>b. It is impossible to bring the Homeric uses of the modes under the categories and rules that prevailed in the Attic period. Intermediate in force between the simple future and the potential optative with dv were </p><p>(1) the subjunctive as a less vivid future, as ov yap iria rotovs ISw dyipaji ovSe t&amp;ofuu A 262 / never yet saw such men nor shall I see them. (H. 868; G. 1321.) </p><p>(2) the subjunctive with k\\xe2\\x82\\xacv or av, as a potential mode, as ct 8c firj SfMoatv, cyctf Sc kcv avros iXcofuu A 137 but if they shall not give it, I myself </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"27\" id=\"27\"/><p>xxiv </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa718c. </p><p>toill then take, etc. ovk dv roi XP^HV \\'^ti^op^s T 54 the cithara would not in that case avail thee. </p><p>c. The subjunctive is used more freely in Homer than in later Greek. </p><p>d. a. Homer prefers a with the subjunctive to c? kcv (a7 k\\xe2\\x82\\xacv) or ei S\\xc2\\xbb with the subjunctive,   ci ay is not used in general conditions. </p><p>p. a fccv is rarely used with the optative (29 times in all); never in the expression of a wish, ci av is used with the optative but once, ci ircp av avroi | fjuovam aeiSoccv B 597 f. </p><p>y. The optative in indirect discourse is used for the indicative in direct discourse only in questions. </p><p>S, In six passages the optative with Key is used in the apodosis, where Homeric and Attic usage alike lead us to expect av with a past tense of the indicative, as kcu vv k\\xe2\\x82\\xacv tvff aaroKwro dvai aa^pStv AlvtCa^y \\\\ ci firi Sp* 6$v vovjce Aios Ovydrrfp *A&lt;l&gt;poS{\\'nj E 311 f. \" Aeneas would have perished if Aphrodite had not perceived,\" etc. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 19. a. The cases retained more of their original force than in Attic and had less need of a preposition to make the construction distinct (it was once thought that the poet omitted the preposition for the convenience of his verse), as the ablatival genitive in cpicos *Axcuounv ?re\\\\cTai fToXc/ACMo KOKoio A 284 is a bulwark for the Achaeans from (to keep off) evil war, KapiraXCfim dvcSu rroXi^^ aXos rjvr opixKrj A 359 swiftly she rose as a mist out of the hoary sea. The dative of place is often found without a preposition, as roC &amp;pjounv \\xe2\\x82\\xacx\\xc2\\xab&gt;v A 45 having his how upon his shoulder. </p><p>b. The prepositions still retained much of their adverbial nature, and had not become fixedly attached to the verbs which they modified (\\xc2\\xa7 55). It was once thought that the occasional separation of verb and preposition was a poetic license, and (considered as a surgical operation) it was called tmesis. </p><p>c. In the Homeric period certain constructions were only beginning to appear definitely in use, such as the accusative with the infinitive, and the genitive absolute. </p><p>d. a. The genitive absolute is more frequent with the present parti* ciple than with the aorist participle. The genitive absolute with omitted Bubject is particularly rare, and is denied by most scholars. The participle sometimes seems to be used with omitted subject when it really agrees with the genitive implied in a preceding dative. </p><p>p. It is often impossible to say categorically whether the genitive is in the absolute construction or rather depends on some other word, as xnrb Sk Tpioes K\\xe2\\x82\\xac)(aSovTO \\\\ avSpos aKovrCaauvTo^ A 497 f., where the position of t^e genitive at the beginning of the verse gives it greater independence, but it was probably influenced by the verb, the Trojans drew </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"28\" id=\"28\"/><p>HOMERIC SYNTAX. </p><p>XXV </p><p>back from the man as he hurled his javelin ; cf. iicXay^av dp* ourroi iir wfifuv \\\\&lt;oofifvoio I avrov KivrjOevToq A 46 f. </p><p>y. Sometimes a preposition is used where the genitive absolute would be used in Attic prose, as afiffn 8c v^c? | (Tfitp^aXiov KovaiPrjauv dvcravrow inr *A)((ii(av B 333 f. </p><p>e. The dative of interest is often used with the verb where the English idiom prefers a possessive genitive with a noun, as heivm 8c ot 6&lt;r&lt;r\\xe2\\x82\\xac &lt;f&gt;a avOtv A 200 terribly did her (lit. for her the) eyes gleam; or is used instead of an ablatival genitive with a preposition, as Aavaouriv deiKca Xoiyov airilxr\\xe2\\x82\\xact A 97 will ward off ignominious destruction from (lit./or) the Danai; or instead of a genitive with verbs of ruling and leading, as iravrccro-i 8* dmo-creiv A 288 to reign over (lit. be the king for) all; or instead of an adverbial expression, as touti 8* dvc\\'oTTy A 68 for them rose (not to be taken as a local dative, among them). </p><p>f. tnro is used with the dative in almost the same sense as with the genitive in Attic, as i^firj wo X^P^^ woSwKeoq AioKtSao B 860 he was slain by the hands of the swift-footed Aeacides, with perhaps more of the original local force of the preposition. </p><p>g. Some constructions were used more freely and constantly than in later Greek. Certain of these were always looked upon as poetic, as OtCri irthiou} Z 507 shall run over the plain, Xav\\xe2\\x82\\xac.crOax worafwio Z 508. For the genitive of the place to which the action belongs, see H. 760; G. 1137. </p><p>h. A neuter noun in the plural is the subject of a plural verb more frequently than in Attic. The imperfect is more freely used in narrative, to describe an action as in progress. The historical present is not used. ccTTi is not always a mere copula, and is occasionally modified by an adverb, as a true verb of existence, of iireC vv roi dau /uvwOd irtp, ov Ti frnKoL Sijv A 416 since thy appointed time of life is brief etc., and fuwvOa 8c oi yeyeff opfi-q A 466 but brief was his onset. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 20. a. Particles, cu The beginner in reading Homer is perplexed by a large number of particles that are often difiicult to render by English words. Their force can often be best given by the order of the words in the translation or by the tone of voice in reading. To translate pd as was natural (or even you see) or yc at least, often throws upon the particle very disproportionate emphasis. The student can most easily and clearly appreciate the force of a particle by comparing a number of examples which have become familiar to him; he will then see the importance of these particles to the character and tone of a speech or of the narrative. </p><p>fi. ri is used far more freely than in Attic prose. A single tc is often used to connect single notions, as kwccto-iv | otcovoto-i tc A 4 f. </p><p>y. 6&lt;l&gt;pa is the usual particle to introduce a final clause. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"29\" id=\"29\"/><p>XX vi </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>f 20h. </p><p>b. Interrogative Particles, a. The general interrogative particle in Homer is ^, but in a doable question (where the Attic Greek uses wore* poy, rj OT stands in the first member, ^ or ^ in the second, cf* A 190 ff. </p><p>p. When ^ introduces a single question, it is rarely used as in Attic, as a mere interrogation point. It regularly implies emotion of some kind. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 21. a. Parataxis, The Homeric language is far less distinct than the Latin or the English in the expression of logical relations, and gives less prominence to the logical forms of syntax; but it is seldom difficult to appreciate the ancient idiom if an attempt is made to find the Homeric point of view. </p><p>The Homeric poems contain many survivals of the simplest form of sentences. In the earliest stage of the Greek language, clauses were not combined with each other as secondary and principal; they were simply added one to the other. To use the technical terms, coordination or parataxis (impoTaii^) was the rule, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not subordination or hypotaxis (wrora^is). Originally the relatives were demonstratives, and relative sentences have been called &lt; parenthetic demonstrative sentences.\\' Thus 8c was used in the apodosis of relative and conditional sentences. This was especially frequent when the relative or conditional clause preceded, as ci 3c ICC fi^ ScooKTiv, cyctf 8c Kcv avro9 ekiofuu A 137 but if they shall not give it, (but) I myself shall then take, etc, clos 6 ravff lopfjuuve . . ^XBe 8* *A&amp;rjvrj A 193 f. while he was pondering thu ... (but) Athena came, oirj irep fl&gt;vW&lt;av ycvci;, Toirj 8c kcu dv8pa&gt;v Z 146 as is the race of leaves, (but) such is also the race of men. So airdp and dAAa are used with stronger emphasis than 8c, as ci 8c (TV KOLprepos ccrori, Oea 8c ore ycLvaro prfrqp \\\\ dX\\\\* o8c ^iprr\\xe2\\x82\\xacp6i lariv lird TrXcdvccrcriv dvourcrci A 280 f. but if thou art mighty and a goddess is thy mother, but, etc, where the apodosis is really contrasted with the protasis, cf A 81 quoted in the next paragraph. </p><p>b. Compare with the foregoing the use of kol in the conclusion of relative sentences, to mark the connection of the clauses. Thus also rc was freely used in subordinate clauses, as os icc $\\xe2\\x82\\xacois hmruBrfrax pjoXa r* IkXvov avrov A 218 whoever obeys the gods, (and) himself the gods readily hear; and rc\\xe2\\x80\\x94tc is found in both protasis and apodosis, marking their correlation, as ci Trcp yap rc xokov . . Karairc^, | dAXa rc icai perairurOey \\xe2\\x82\\xacX^i Korov A 81 f. for even if he should restrain his wrath, but even here-after etc </p><p>c. The first part of a paratactic sentence may introduce the cause or reason for what follows, as in Andromache\\'s words to Hector, \"Eicrop Arap (TV pjoL io\\'O\\'L Trarrjp koI ttotvul prjfryjp, \\\\ 178^ Koxrlyvrjfrof^, ov 8c pjot Ba\\xc2\\xbb X\\xe2\\x82\\xacpo^ mpoKOLTtyi\\' I aXX dye vvy i\\\\&amp;up\\xe2\\x82\\xac koI ovtov tiiwf cttI ?rupy&lt;p Z 429 fE. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"30\" id=\"30\"/><p>THE HOMERIC DIALECT. </p><p>xxvii </p><p>But thoUf Hector, art my father etc.y which uuplies Hector, since thou art my all.\" </p><p>d. Correlative Constructions, The Greek language was always fond of a parallel or antithetic construction, a contrast, a balance, where the English subordinates one thought to the other; but the adversative relation, where the English idiom would use a subordinate clause introduced by for, although, when, while, or since, is more frequent in these poems than in later Greek, as oXAa wCOea-ff * afi^a&gt; Sk vtwipm iarov i/ielo A 259, &lt;l&gt;vXXa ra /xey r* avc/i09 x^fwJ^i^ xiei, aWa 8c ff vXrf \\\\ TrfXeOowra ^vo, eopos 8* hriyCyverax iLprq Z 147 f. . . when the season of Spring comes on, \\'^fiky 817 TTor* ifiai wdpoi IkXv\\xe2\\x82\\xac9 \\xe2\\x82\\xacv^a/jL\\xe2\\x82\\xacvoio . . ^8* In koL vvv fiM rdS* etru^prfqvcv ifXSfop A 453 ff. as thou didst hear my former prayer so now also fulfil this my desire. </p><p>e. avrdp also is used where a causal paiiiicle would be used in English, as oBvygai wewap/Aevoq * avrap otoros | (S/iuo cvt aTtj3ap&lt;p lyXi/Aaro E 399 f. thrilled with pains since the arrow was fixed in his stout shoulder. </p><p>f. In these contrasted clauses, av, avrc, avrdp, ardp, aXXd, as well as 8e, may be used in correlation with /jLcy. </p><p>g. A copulative conjunction is sometimes used where the English uses a disjunctive or, as rpiirXy tct/klttX^ tc A 128 threefold or (and) fourfold, in which prominence is given to the second member. Cf. ha koI 8uo B 346, x^\\'i^ </p><p>irpml^d B 303, Tpt^^a re koi rerpaxBd V 363, O terque quaterque beati, Verg. Aen. I. 94. </p><p>. h. The Homeric poet sometimes puts into an independent clause the incidental thought which in later Greek would be expressed regularly by a participle, as Aaoc 8* ^p-qauvro Oeol^ 18c xelpa^ aLV\\xe2\\x82\\xacaxpv T 318 the people prayed to the gods with uplifted hands (lit. and lifted their hands) for x^H^\\'S ayaxrx6vT\\xe2\\x82\\xac^, cf. /leydX \\xe2\\x82\\xacv;(cto, x^ipa? ^yaax\\'^y A 450; (Zcvs /lepfii^piie c5s *AxiX^) Tifn^frrj, oXiarj Sk iroXia^ iirl vrpjolv ^AxpJMV B 4 was pondering how he might honor Achilles by destroying (lit. and destroy) etc.; cf yXOe ^cpaiv, Ix^^ A 12 f.; AXX* oK&amp;mm KoBrfo-o, cfuu 8* hriireiOeo fivO&lt;^ A 565 for ipj^ TTtiSo/Aevq pvOw.   See \\xc2\\xa7 11 g. </p><p>i. Conversely, the participle, as in later Greek, often contains the principal idea, as Kareycvo\\'cv | *I\\\\tov iKwipauvr cvreix^ov aTrovieaOoL B 113 promised that I should sack Ilios, and return, but in the very next verse is the English idiom, vvv 8c Koicqv airdrrfv PovXcwmTo, koC /eac kcXcvci | dvaxXia \"Apyoi ucea^ai B 114 f. planned an evU deceit and bids me go etc., for hrdr rrjv PovXevau^. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 22. THE HOMERIC DIALECT, a. The dialect of the Homeric poems is in one sense artificial: it was spoken at no place and at no time.  But it is not a mosaic composed of words, and forms chosen capri</p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"31\" id=\"31\"/><p>xxviii </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa722 b. </p><p>cioosly from the different Greek dialects; it is a product of natural growth. The poets unconsciously excluded all that was not adapted to dactylic verse, but they did no violence to their language; they did not wantonly change quantities or introduce new terminations. </p><p>b. The conservation of old forms together with the introduction of new forms was very convenient for the verse; e.g. for the infinitive of the verb to he. Homer could use c/i/ticm as dactyl, _ w w ; cficvai as anapaest, \\\\j \\\\j ; tfjLyuev as trochee, ^ ; tijucv as pyrrhic, \\\\j \\\\j; civou as </p><p>spondee, . Naturally, the choice being offered, metrical convenience determined which of these forms should be used. Metrical convenience often or generally decided between the use of \\'Axatot or *Apy\\xe2\\x82\\xacioL We must always remember that the Homeric dialect was not a modification of the Attic dialect, and was not derived from it, but that it represents an older stage of the language. Many Attic forms can be derived from the Homeric forms. </p><p>c. The same is true in the case of synonyms and stock epithets or phrases, dvai dvSpcuv \\'Aya/ic/ivw is used after the feminine caesura (\\xc2\\xa7 58 y) of the third foot, but \\xe2\\x82\\xacvpv Kpeiwv \\'Aya/icfivwv, \\'Aya/icfivovos \\'ArpciSdo, or \\'Aya/icftvova TroL/Aem Xawv after the masculine caesura of the same foot. HrjXrjia^fa \\'A^^^os is used after the penthemimeral caesura (\\xc2\\xa7 58 e), TToSa? w#cv5 \\'Ax^XXcvs after the hephthemimeral caesura (\\xc2\\xa7 58 g), but iroSdpKrjs 8105 *A;(tAAcvs, 7ro8a)KCos AiaKiSao or a^vfiovo^ AtaKtSao^ ToSapKei HrjXetwvt, Tro&amp;oKca HrfXeCwva, a/iv/xova HrjXeiwva, or *AxtXX.rja, moXiiropBov, after the feminine caesura of the third foot, with SZbs \\'A;(tA3 Xcvs as a tag when the verse is filled up to the Bucolic diaeresis (\\xc2\\xa7 58 ^). Cf. the epithets of Apollo, kKarouo A 385 \\\\j \\\\j \\\\j, iicrjPoXxnj A14 ^ w </p><p>cKocpyos A 479 ^ kj vy, \\xe2\\x82\\xacKaTrjP6\\\\ov A 370 \\\\j \\\\j \\\\j cxan^/ScXeroo </p><p>A 75 w    \\xe2\\x80\\x94       ^ v^.   See \\xc2\\xa7 12 6. </p><p>d. The dialect is essentially Ionic and seems to have originated among the lonians of Asia Minor, influenced possibly by the speech and cer. tainly far more by the old poems of their Aeolian neighbors. The oldest form of Greek Epic songs seems to have been Aeolic, but the lonians brought Epic poetry to perfection. Even the Pythian priestess delivered the oracles of Apollo in Epic verse and Ionic dialect, and the Dorian Spartans sang about their camp-fires the Ionian songs of Tyrtaeus. </p><p>e. Some forms seem to be borrowed from other dialects; but it must be remembered that when the poems were composed, there was less difference between the dialects than at the earliest period when we have monumental evidence concerning them. </p><p>f. Some anomalies of form (as of verse) are as yet unexplained, but it may be assumed that all which remain either (1) were justified by the </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"32\" id=\"32\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa725. </p><p>THE HOMERIC DIALECT. </p><p>zxix </p><p>usage of the people and might be explained by more complete knowledge of the history of the language, or (2) followed the analogy of what was in use, or (3) are errors which have found their way into the text during the course of transmission to the present time. As the poems were handed down among the Greeks at first orally, and afterwards still uncritically for centuries, errors unavoidably crept in and there was a gradual assimilation of what was obsolete to later and more familiar forms, when the older forms were unprotected by the metre. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 23. Vowels and Vowel Changes, a. -q is regularly used for a, as dyopi^y ofioirjy except in Ota goddess, Xao? people, and some proper names (as Aivcias). Occasionally, as B 370, /iav is found instead of the less frequent ftiyv (the strong form of p.fv), SXto A 532 (from aXKopm) is another instance of a, unless it is to be written oXra   (H. 30 D.) </p><p>b. The final a of the stem is retained in the genitive endings -ao and -acDv of the 1st declension, as \\'ArpctlSao A 203. </p><p>c. ao is often changed to ca&gt; by transfer of quantity: *A.rp\\xe2\\x82\\xac&amp;ajo, *Ar/[&gt;Ci8\\xc2\\xa3(tf. Cf, PaxnX^ with Attic jSooxXcW* But the frequent Ado9 never has the Attic form Xcq&gt;9. </p><p>d. Compensative lengthening is sometimes found where it is not in Attic, as $\\xe2\\x82\\xacivo&lt;s (fey/ro?), civcKa (Lesbian Imxa), Kovfyq (^Kopfd), pxnjvo^j </p><p>e. Diphthongs occasionally preserve i where it is lost in Attic before a vowel: cuct, alero^, ctcXcicto (\\xc2\\xa7 47 g), oivoPapcdaVf oXjot-q, irvoLrjy </p><p>f. But I is lost before a vowel in (Sk&amp;i ((okcoi) *lpis B 786, in -co for -oio as genitive-ending of the 2d declension (\\xc2\\xa7 35 6), and in c/xio for ifuio, etc.; cf. Xpixraots A 246 with )(pv&lt;r\\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;a A15. As in Attic, the penult is sometimes short in vuk (as A 489, A 473). In these cases i has turned into the ^sound. Likewise v is sometimes dropped between two vowels. See \\xc2\\xa7 59 A; 8. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 24. Contraction, Concurrent vowels generally remain uncontracted: icicQ&gt;v, aXyeOf iroi? (in nominative and vocative singular), at? (o/ri? = ovis, ewe). Attic ev is regularly ho before two consonants, and the adjective is always cv? or ^ife. Patronymics from nouns in -cvs form -ctSi/s, -cW, as \\xe2\\x80\\xa2Arpcf&amp;75 A 7, HiyXcfwva A 197.   (H. 37 D; G. 846.) </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 25. Synizesis, a. Vowels which do not form a true diphthong may be blended in pronunciation into one long sound: *Ar/[&gt;ci8ea&gt; v-\\' v-\\' , </p><p>tf\\xe2\\x82\\xac0\\xe2\\x82\\xaci8\\xc2\\xabi r 27, 8^ avT\\xe2\\x82\\xac A 340, iroXtos B 811, *l&lt;rriauiv B 537, in which last </p><p>two examples i must have had very nearly the pronunciation of its cognate y-sound. The genitives in -ceo, -ewv are always pronounced with synizesis.  (H. 42 D; G. 47.) </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"33\" id=\"33\"/><p>XXX </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>f 25 b. </p><p>b. Synizesis often served the purpose of the later contraction. -^fUm did not differ in metrical quantity from i^/muv. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 26. Crasis is not frequent. Note rouycxa A 291, uwroi \\xc2\\xa3 396, X^/Acis B 238 (km i7ft\\xe2\\x82\\xacts).   (H. 76; G. 42 ft.) </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 27. Hiatus (H. 75 D; G. 34) is allowed. </p><p>a. After the vowels i and v, as ^x^^ o^ocvrt E 50. </p><p>b. When the two vowels between which it occurs are separated by a caesura (ko^Qoto hnyvdfuffam A 569) or by a diaeresis (\\xc2\\xa7 58 h) : seldom after the first foot (avrap o iyv&lt;a A 333), more frequently after the fourth foot (^yxca o^vocvra E 568). Hiatus between the short syllables of the third foot is allowed nearly as frequently as in all other places together, more than 200 times. This freedom of hiatus emphasizes the prominence of this caesura, \\xc2\\xa7 58 d, </p><p>c. When the final vowel of the first word is long and stands in the accented part of the foot (\\xc2\\xa7 57 a), as    o-c koxq (uotj A 418.   See \\xc2\\xa7 59 i&amp;c. </p><p>d. When a long vowel or diphthong loses part of its quantity before the following vowel (\\xc2\\xa7 59 it), as t^v S* cyw ov \\\\v(r&lt;a A 29, fwy vv rot ov Xpaiafiy A 28. Here the final and initial vowels may be said to be blended. This is called weak or improper hiatus; it is essentially the same as the following. </p><p>e. When the last vowel of the first word is already elided, as fivpC \\'Axcuocs aXye i$rfK\\xe2\\x82\\xacv A 2. </p><p>f. Hiatus before words which formerly began with a consonant (\\xc2\\xa7 32) is only apparent. </p><p>g. The poet did not avoid two or more concurrent vowels in the same word, \\xc2\\xa7 24. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 28. Elision. (H. 79; G. 48.) a. a (in inflectional endings and in &amp;pa aud pa), c, t, o may be elided, ai is sometimes elided in the verb endings, ot is elided seven times in /W, three times in roi, once in &lt;rol A 170 (unless ou8c oxm otco or ov aoi 6m should be read there for oi)8c &lt;T oifo). </p><p>b. TO, irpd, avTL, irepC, ri, and the conjunction ort do not suifer elision; is for ore (either the temporal conjunction or the relative o with rc </p><p>affixed, \\xc2\\xa7 42 m), t for ri or rot. </p><p>c. i is seldom elided in the dative singular, where it seems originally to have been long. </p><p>d. Oxytone prepositions and conjunctions lose their accent in elision; other oxytones throw the acute accent upon the preceding syllable, as ra KOK [xcuca] A 107.  Elision is not left to the reader as in Latin poetry. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 29. Apocope. (H. 84 D; G. 53.) a. Before a consonant, the short final vowel of Sipa and of the prepositions db^ Kara, Trapa, may be cut off </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"34\" id=\"34\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa730 j. </p><p>THE HOMERIC DIALECT. </p><p>xxxi </p><p>(dTTOKom;, dTTOKoirrw). The accent is then thrown back upon the preceding syllable (although it might be more rational to consider it lost as it is in elision). </p><p>b. After apocope, the v of dvd and r of Kara follow the usual rules for consonant changes: dfiweTraXiav T 355, KafiPaXtv E 343 (Karc)3aXev), Kah hi {Kara 8c) frequently, KoKrave Z 164 (icarcKravc), Kamrtacrqv E 560, Koppi^ovaa E 424. </p><p>c. avepvaav A 459 is explained as derived by apocope, assimilation, and vocalization of p, from dm and /rcpvo). </p><p>d. Apocope was no mere metrical license; it was common in the conversational idiom of some dialects. More striking examples of apocope and assimilation than any in Homer are found in prose inscriptions. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 30. Consonants and Consonant Changes, a. Where collateral forms appear, one with single and the other with doubled consonants, the form with two consonants is generally the older or justified etymolog^cally, as woaa-Cf woa-C (from 7ro8-&lt;rt) ; veiKecae, veiKece (vcikos, vctxco\"-), oinrct)9 (oK/:(i)s, cf, Latin quis etc,)j orri, ktX. </p><p>b. Single initial consonants, especially X, fi, v, p, o*, are often doubled (as /:&gt; is in Attic) when by inflexion or composition a short vowel is brought before them (see \\xc2\\xa7 59 A), as cAAtWcro Z 45. </p><p>c. But sometimes p is not doubled where it would be in Attic, as (OKv/MMp E 598, KaT\\xe2\\x82\\xacp\\xe2\\x82\\xac$\\xe2\\x82\\xacv A 361. </p><p>d. Palatal and lingual mutes often remain unchanged before /a, as </p><p>thp\\xc2\\xa3Vy K\\xe2\\x82\\xacKOpvOfl\\xe2\\x82\\xacVOq, </p><p>e. Lingual mutes are commonly assimilated to a following a, as iroa-al (ttoS-o-i). &lt;r is sometimes assimilated to p. or v: Ippjsvai (ttvai) for co-pjevoLj dpy\\xe2\\x82\\xacw6^ white for d/)y\\xe2\\x82\\xaco--vos, as apyewdtuv T 198, hnnjpi for /rco*vu/u (\\xc2\\xa7 32 a), iptfionr^ E 659 dark, cf, \"lEpc^Sos. </p><p>f. o\" is frequently retained before c, as laaopai, ctcXco-cc. </p><p>g. Between p and \\\\or p, p is sometimes developed, as dpPpoT&lt;K from stem pLpo or /uiop (Latin wiors, morior), while in Pporo^ mortal, the p of the stem is lost; pippKtaKt from pXo or pxiK (cf. l/xoXov). </p><p>h. Kdp,paX\\xc2\\xa3 is found occasionally, in the Mss. as a variant reading, a softer pronunciation for Kafifiake (\\xc2\\xa7 29 6). </p><p>i. A parasitic t appears in irroXis, -nToXc/ios for iroXis, ttoXc/aos. Cf. SixOd, rpixOd with Attic hixpiy rpCxO\" The proper names Neoptolemus (NeoirroXc/ios) and Ptolemy (JlToX.\\xe2\\x82\\xacpmos) preserved this t to a late period. </p><p>j. The rough breathing (h) has no power to prevent elision or weaken hiatus. The smooth breathing is found with several words which have the rough breathing in Attic, as dppje (rjpas), vt^P (from mXXopm), i7e\\\\co9 (^fXios), *At8i;s {\"Ai&amp;rjq), lycSs (ca&gt;9). </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"35\" id=\"35\"/><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa730k. </p><p>k. The V movable was written by some ancient critics after the ending -\\xe2\\x82\\xact of the pluperfect, as jScjSXiyKctv E 661, ijvcuyctv Z 170; cf. rjaKW T 388 (170-Kccv). It is freely used before consonants to make a syllable long by position (\\xc2\\xa7 59/). </p><p>1. The final o- of adverbs is omitted more often than in prose. Not merely i$ and ix, ovrctis and ouro), but also ttcSs and ircli, 7roAAaict9 and TroAXaici, Afi^k and afi&lt;t&gt;C (adverbial), are found as collateral forms. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 31. Metathesis of a and p is frequent (H. 64; G. 64): Kop^rj B 452, KfKL^rf a 353; Kofyrurroi. A 266, Kparo9 A 509. Cf. rpaweiofjuev T 441 from T\\xe2\\x82\\xacfyir&lt;t), r\\xe2\\x82\\xacp?rtK\\xe2\\x82\\xacpavvo9 from rpejria. </p><p>For the shifting of quantity from -ao to -co), see \\xc2\\xa7 23 c. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 32. The Digamma, (H. 72 D.) a. The following words seem to have been pronounced by the Homeric poet more or less consistently with initial digamma (vau, p, pronounced as English to) : \\xe2\\x80\\x94 </p><p>ayyvpjL break, 0X19 enough, aXxavax am captured, avai king, avhaym please, dfxuds thin, apvo^ lamb, axrrv city, I, oS, ol him, etc. with a possessive pronoun OS, Tj, 6v (\\xe2\\x82\\xac05 ktX.), cap Spring, eOvoi tribe, ukogl twenty, aK&lt;a yield, elpia say, (future cpccu), iKos far, Ikootos each, cicvpos father-in4aw, iK&lt;ov willing, iXIa-Cia wind, iKiropm hope, hnropj, (/rcc-vu/u) clothe, \\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;r$i^, etfrnra clothes, cTTOs word, Ipyov, epSo) work, ipvw, draw, Itos year. If six, In/s comr panion, ^8vs sweet, (av&amp;iv(i&gt; please), ^^os haunt, lax^ cry aloud, iSctv see, (and oTSo, \\xe2\\x82\\xac?8o9), iKcXos, cotica a7n 19, i^c strength, sinew, To-os e^uaZ, trvs ^//yi oTkos oTvos trine. </p><p>b. Probably lypa (iirl ^pa &lt;^\\xe2\\x82\\xacp&lt;i)v A 572), *I\\\\tos, and Hpis, and several other words, also were pronounced with initial f. </p><p>c. av&amp;ii/a&gt;, I, licvpos, % and others seem to have begun originally with two consonants, &lt;rf. </p><p>d. The verse alone affords no sufficient test for the former existence of f in any word; it only indicates the loss of some consonant. This is not conclusive evidence for p, since o- and j (y) were also lost. Which consonant originally was present has to be learned in each case from inscriptions of other Greek dialects, from a few notes of ancient grammarians, and from other cognate languages (cf Ipycv work, oTvos wine). </p><p>e. The sound of p evidently was going out of use in the Homeric period. It is not infrequently neglected in our texts, and sometimes thi^ neglect seems to be due to the poet himself, but p can be restored in many passages by minor changes. For vi^v jeKyj^oXoy A 21 it is possible to read via ptK-rj^okov, for Travrco-o-i ^ avdxraav A 288 it is easy to read Trao-tv 8c pavdarmv, and x^/^^ peKTfPoXov for ^cpo-tv \\xe2\\x82\\xacKrjP6Xov A 14. Perhaps KTtivai fi\\xe2\\x82\\xacv p dXecivc Z 167 may have been ktciku fitv pe ktX. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"36\" id=\"36\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa734c. </p><p>THE HOMERIC DIALECT. </p><p>xxxiii </p><p>f. That the sound of p was still alive in the Homeric age is shown by the accuracy of the poet in its use where comparative philology shows that it once existed. </p><p>g. f sometimes leaves a trace of its existence in its cognate vowel v: avcpvcrav A 459 for oLfipvauv (\\xc2\\xa7 29 c), ToXavpivw E 289 for raXa-fpivov. So doubtless aTrovpas A 356 for airo-fpds, </p><p>h. Some irregularities of quantity may be explained by this vocalization of f. Thus &amp;tro\\xe2\\x82\\xacnr&lt;ov T 35 may have been &amp;irof\\xe2\\x82\\xacnr&lt;av pronounced nearly as dTrovciTrcov. avuixpi finds its analogy in yeVero laxq A 456 (yeverovuLXij)\\' </p><p>L A neighboring vowel is sometimes lengthened to compensate for the loss of f (\\xc2\\xa7 59 c). </p><p>j. An e was sometimes prefixed to a digammated word and remained after the f was lost, as ^eXScop, itucoa-i, ecpyci, cc. </p><p>k. Sometimes the rough breathing represents the last remnant of a lost consonant (especially in the words which once began with (rp, as av8av(i&gt; KTk.f cf. c above), as \\xe2\\x82\\xacKiov, ccTTrcpos- Often the same root varies in breathing, as av&amp;iv(i&gt; and 178^9, but rjBfK, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 evw/u, but \\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;rOip. </p><p>1. For the augment and reduplication of digammated verbs, see \\xc2\\xa7 43 (f. </p><p>m. For 8^aSo&gt;, S/ri/v, see \\xc2\\xa7 59 h. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 33. Declension. Special Case Endings. (H.217; G.292ff.) a. The suffix -^(v), a remnant of an old instrumental case, added to the stem forms a genitive and dative in both singular and plural. </p><p>b. The suffix -Oi is added to the stem to denote place where. </p><p>c. The suffix -Oev is added to the stem to denote j9/ace whence: l&amp;rfiev from Ida, otvpavoOev from heaven. It forms a genitive with the pronominal stems, as c^ev etveica F 128, irpo tOev E 96. </p><p>d. The enclitic -Sc is added to the accusative to denote more distinctly the limit of motion: cmkov^ homeward (also diKaSe, especially of the return of the Achaeans to their homes) ovSe SofwvSe to his own house, aAa&amp; seaward, KXurCqv&amp;e to the tent. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 34. First Declension. (H. 134 ff.; G. 168 ff.) a. 17 is found for final a of the stem with the exceptions mentioned in \\xc2\\xa7 23. </p><p>b. The nominative singular of some masculines ends in -ra for -n^: fjLTjrCera counsellor. Cf. the Latin poeta, nauta. evpvoira far-sounding is used also as accusative, e.g. A 498. </p><p>AU of these words are adjectival (titular) except \\xc2\\xa9vcWa B 107. </p><p>c. The genitive singular of masculines ends in -do or (by transfer of quantity, \\xc2\\xa7 23 c), -ceo. After a vowel this ending may be contracted to -\\xc2\\xab&gt;, as Aiveto) E 534, Bopco) 4^ 692. The ending -ceo is always pronounced as one syllable by synizesis (\\xc2\\xa7 25). </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"37\" id=\"37\"/><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa734d. </p><p>d.

Second Declension. (H. 151 ff.; G. 189 ff.) a. The genitive singular has preserved the old ending -to, which affixed to the stem vowel makes -olo. </p><p>b. The temiination -co is indicated by the metre in certain places where all the Mss. give a corrupt form, as o^treXcorov oo kXco^ ov ttot oXeirai B 325. It is to be recognized also in Ilcrcaio B 552 for Ilercaoo, from Ilcrcciis for Ilcrcoos. </p><p>For the loss of t in the change from -ou&gt; to oo, see \\xc2\\xa7 23 /. The -oo was afterwards contracted to ov. </p><p>c. The genitive and dative dual end in -ouv: touv, &amp;fwuv. </p><p>d. The dative plural ends in -ourt(v) or -ots. As in the first declension, the long ending is the rule; the short ending is very rare before a consonant. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 36. Third Declension, (H. 163 ff.; G. 205 ff.) a. The ending i of the dative singular is sometimes long, and sometimes short. It is seldom elided. It is often long before a ^gle consonant: Au fjo/riv droXavros, cf. vTTcp/Acvct &lt;IhXjov B 116. </p><p>b. The dative plural has the Aeolic ending \\xe2\\x80\\xa2&lt;a\\'&lt;n(v) as well as the Attic -&lt;n(y) : iroSco-o-i, troaa-i (\\xc2\\xa7 30 e), ttoo-i, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 av^a-ai, dvSpacri, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Kwcccn, KV&lt;rC. </p><p>c. Nouns in and -V9 usually retain t or v throughout, but in its stead may insert e which is sometimes lengthened. </p><p>d. Nouns in -cvs generally lengthen c to i; in compensation (\\xc2\\xa7 59 c) for the V which between two vowels becomes f and is lost, as jSoo-iAcv?, </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 37. Anomalow forms, a. As verbs appear in the present system with a variety of collateral forms derived from the same root (cf. wcoi, iKaviOy tKvcofuu, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 wevOofmif irwOdvofJuUf \\xe2\\x80\\x94 fieviaj fUfivat, fitfivdCui), so nouns of different declensions are- sometimes formed from the same root and are used without appreciable difference of meaning. </p><p>b. Some nouns have both vowel and consonant stems: oXki^ T 45, but aXw E 299; ip(rjpo&lt;s craipo? A 266, but ipCrfpes craipoi T 378; cf TToXtifras B 806 with TroXirai. </p><p>c. Of V109, three stems are found: (1) vlos, vlov, vU. The other forms of this declension are very rare. (2) vUos, vlct, vi&amp;i as if from vlv^. (3) vUk, vii, via, as from a nominative vU* </p><p>In this word the first syllable is sometimes short (\\xc2\\xa7 23/), as it often is in Attic and in other dialects. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"38\" id=\"38\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa739g. </p><p>THE HOMERIC DIALECT. </p><p>XXXV </p><p>d. Certain names of cities are found in both singular and plural: MvK^ A\" 52, MvK-qvas B 569 ; \\xc2\\xaerjPry: A 378, (^fia^ E 804. Instead of the later plural \\xc2\\xae\\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;T7ruu, TLXaTcuaCf Homer uses only the singular: 0e&lt;nr\\xe2\\x82\\xacuiv B 498, nXarotav B 504. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 38. Adjectives, a. Somie adjectives of three terminations are used as if of two terminations, t.e. the masculine form is used also for the feminine: iipiOCfwv^ ilrvxds A 8, kXvtos *lmro8d/uui B 742, \"^tpa wovXvv E 776, UvXxHo ^fmOoeyroi B 77. </p><p>b. The feminine of adjectives in -vs, ends in -\\xc2\\xaba (gen. -ciiys), -ca (\\xc2\\xa7 23/), or -\\xe2\\x82\\xac17: i3a^\\xe2\\x82\\xac\"\\xc2\\xbb\\xc2\\xbb ^Sa^coys, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 wxca, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 jgo^o/s, PaOirfv. </p><p>c. 7ro\\\\v9 (irovkus) has in the masculine and neuter both stems ttoXv* (ttovXv-) and iroXXo- (for iroKvo-, \\xc2\\xa7 37 a), with a nearly complete set of forms for each: ttoAAo? and woXXov, ttoXcos, ttoXcc?, ttqXccdv, ttoXcWo\\'i, ktX. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 39. Patronymics. (H. 559; G. 846 f.) a. Suffixes which origin nally expressed connection or possession were used to form patronymic adjectives. The original force of these suffixes is occasionally preserved: (0\\xe2\\x82\\xacoi) Ovpaviiuves A 570 is a mere adjective of connection like (^cowriv) IjrovpaviouTi Z 129; Homer does not recognize Ovpavo^ as the ancestor of the gods. \\'OXv/A7ria8c9 funnTcu B 491 is equivalent to fjunkrai \\'OXvfiTria B(OfmT \\xe2\\x82\\xac\\\\ovirai B 484. </p><p>b. Patronymics are frequently used as proper names, cf, \\'ArpaSi;? A 7, Mevoiria^; A 307, before the names Agamemnon-f Patroclus had been mentioned. </p><p>A. c. The patronymic is formed from stems of the 1st declension by adding : kvyqua&amp;io B 624, or more frequently by adding -co&amp;i-: AacpTto&amp;ys r 200. </p><p>d. This analogy, giving an ending in -ia&amp;7s\\xc2\\xbb is followed by stems in -to of the 2d declension: McvotrioSi/s. So also by stems of the 3d declension: HiyXiTuCSew A 1 (as well as HiyXcifSi/s S 316, HiyXctoiva A 197). See j below. </p><p>e. The suffix -t&amp;t- is added to stems in o, and the o is lost as in d above: ILpov&amp;q^y \\xe2\\x80\\x94 also to stems in cv, which lose their v between two vowels {cf, 23 /): \\'ArpeCSvfs A 7, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 also to consonantal stems, as \\'Aya/ufivovCSrii a 30. ^AvOcfjuSvp A 488 is formed as from \"AvOcfw^ rather than from \\'Av^c/uW (*Av^\\xe2\\x82\\xac/uo)vos vioy A 473). </p><p>f. Patronymics from stems in -cv, after the loss of the v, do not hi Homer suffer contraction of the c of the stem with the i of the suffix. The poet says \\'ArpciSi/s, \\'Arpcfoiv, as tetrasyllables not trisyllables. The verse ictus never falls on the ci. </p><p>g. Female patronymics are formed by the suffix -t8- which loses 8 before the nominative sign: XpvfrrfCSa (acc. of Xpv(rrf(s) A 182, BpurrfC8a A 184.  \\'AxouiSes B 235 corresponds to Kovpoi \\'AxajiSiv A 473. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"39\" id=\"39\"/><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa739h. </p><p>B. h. Patronymics are formed also by the suffix -lov : Kpoi^iW A 528 (with genitive Kpono&gt;i/os or KptMovoi), ^Arpetuiv, n^XcicDv. In these last forms from nouns in -cvs the i is always short </p><p>i. The corresponding female patronymic is found in ^Aifyqarivrf E412. </p><p>j. TaXoLovCSao B 566 is irregular; it seems to be formed by a cumulation of suffixes from TaAao9. So AaofjASovria&amp;r/^ (AaofjASovrta&amp;rf T 250) is formed from AaofieSovruys which itself appeal\\'s as a patronymic (in the form AofLcSovrio?) in a Boeotian inscription. </p><p>k. Some adjectives in -io\\xc2\\xab are used as patronymics, as TcAofuavio? Atas B 528. </p><p>1. The patronymics in -81/9 are far more numerous than those in -uaif, </p><p>m. The patronymic is sometimes derived from the grandfather\\'s name: Achilles is called AIolkC^ B 860; Priam, ^ofAivC^ T 303; the two grandsons of Actor, *AKTOp{&lt;ay\\xe2\\x82\\xac B 621. Thus in later poetry, Heracles is called Alcides (\\'AXicaSi;?) from Amphitryo\\'s father \\'AAxaZbs or \\'AXxev?. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 40. Comparison of Adjectives, a. Comparatives and superlatives end in -twv, -ottos more frequently than in Attic.   (H. 253; G. 72.) </p><p>b. dya^os has comparatives dpctW (cf, apurros), PtKrepov, KptCfranWy X&lt;otov, &lt;l&gt;\\xe2\\x82\\xacpT\\xe2\\x82\\xacpOi. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 41. Numerals. (H. 288; G. 372 f.) a. m has a collateral form US Z 422; cf. the feminine form la A 437. </p><p>b. Suo), Svo is indeclinable.  It has the collateral forms SouS^ Socot, ktX. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 42. Pronouns. (H. 261 ff.; G.389 ff.) a. The oblique cases of the 3d personal pronoun when enclitic are * anaphoric,\\' like avrdv ktX. in Attic; when accented they have their original reflexive use, like Attic cavrou, Ipavrav, aeavrovy ktX., which compounds are post-Homeric. </p><p>b. fuv, a\\'&lt;lHi)\\xe2\\x82\\xac, o-^ohV, a\\'&lt;l&gt;Lf 0*^9, and o-^c are always enclitic. </p><p>c. For the relation of the form i/uio to ifiio, of atio to o-co, ktX., see \\xc2\\xa723/ </p><p>d. avros regularly retains its intensive force in the oblique cases, even when not connected with a noun expressed, often marking a contrast nvhich it is difficult to render smoothly in the English idiom. Cf. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7iiy&gt;. </p><p>The presumption is always strongly in favor of the original meaning; but all shades of meaning are found from the strict intensive to the simple anaphoric use of the Attic dialect. </p><p>e. For avrm in the sense of wa-avrm, see g below. In this use it has a large variety of meanings, as (a&lt;^pom t ) avT&lt;os T 220 a mere (simpleton) ; without cause A 520, toithout a prize A 133, absolutely B 138, vainly B 342, without chariot E 255.  Most of these meanings are derived from in the </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"40\" id=\"40\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa743c. </p><p>THE HOMERIC DIALECT. </p><p>zxxvii </p><p>same way as before, the connectioa determining the special sense of each passage. </p><p>f. The Attic article 6, ^, ro, generally retains its demonstrative force in Homer, but like the intensive pronoun in the oblique cases, appears occasionally in its Attic signification. </p><p>In their demonstrative use, 6, ^, ol, at, are best written o, 17, oc^ at. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Toti Tolf Tws are used besides otj at, </p><p>g. Thus the absence of the article does not mark a noun as indefinite; cf. iirjiwu aci&amp; O^a A 1 with arm a virumque cano. Frequently avra&gt;9 is equivalent to Attic wra-vrta^ (ci&gt;9 being the adverb of the article, see / above and \\xc2\\xa7 56 c) while S* avrcos T 339 is equivalent to Attic ouro) S* axravTQis. </p><p>h. The demonstrative article is often followed by a noun in apposition with it, as oi ^ ixdfnjfmv \\'A^cuoi tc Tpwes t\\xe2\\x82\\xac T 111, btU these rejoiced, both Achaeans and Trojans, avrap 6 Povv Upevaev ava( avSpSw ^AytLfjuifivwy B 402 but he, Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed an ox, </p><p>i. The forms with initial t often have a relative force, but refer only to a definite antecedent. This is a relic of paratactic construction (\\xc2\\xa7 21), as is particularly clear in dAAa ra /icv ttoXiW i^etrpajSofJiev ra heSeurrai A 125 but what we took as spoils from the cities, these have been divided, </p><p>j. K\\xe2\\x82\\xacii/os is often found for \\xe2\\x82\\xacKCivo9. </p><p>k. Besides the Attic forms of the relative, o is used for 09, oov (better So, \\xc2\\xa7 35 5) for o5. </p><p>1. The forms 09 and 8 have also a demonstrative use, especially 09 with ovSc, fii^Sc, KOI, and yap. </p><p>For the relative use of the article, see i above. </p><p>m. The neuter o is frequently used as a conjunction, like quod. So also ori and o re. </p><p>n. The indefinite and interrogative pronouns have genitive singular </p><p>TCO, TCl5. </p><p>o. In o Tis for Ss ns (cf, 6 for os, k above), the first stem often remains nninfiected. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 43. CoNJUGATiox. Augment and Reduplication. (H. 354 ff.; G. 610 ff.) a. The augment was for a time considered unessential: whether temporal or syllabic, it may be omitted in the Homeric poems; the accent is then thrown back as far as possible, as rcv^e A 4, oAcKovro A 10, d&lt;^\\'ei A 25. </p><p>b. When the augment is omitted, monosyllabic forms with long vowel take the circumflex accent, as Prj for IjSi;. </p><p>c. Sometimes initial p is not doubled after the augment, as Ipc^c B 400; sometimes initial X, fi, or o- is doubled after the augment </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"41\" id=\"41\"/><p>xxxviii </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa74.3d. </p><p>d. Stems which originally began with a consonant may take the syllabic augment or reduplication, as Icittov, ci/kc, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 cotxa, lopya. </p><p>e. The second aorist active and middle, of verbs whose stem begins with a consonant, is often found with a reduplicated stem, as CKcicXero, dfi7rc7raA.a&gt;v, \\xe2\\x82\\xacT\\xe2\\x82\\xacTfJue, rervKOvro. </p><p>f. The so-called Attic reduplication is more common in Homer than in Attic, and its use extends to the second aorist where the augment also may be used (c/. Attic ijyayw), as ^papc, and the peculiar form -^vCmnrt B 245 from iviTma in which the final consonant of the theme is reduplicated with a as a connective. </p><p>g. SciSoiKa and SctiSca have irregular reduplication; probably these are to be explained as for ScS/rotKa, ScS^ta. </p><p>h. i/AfjLopa (from /jueCpofJuu) and ia-avfuu (from o-cvco) double the initial consonant and prefix c as if they began with two consonants. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 44. Endings, (H. 375 ff.; G. 551 ff., 777 ff.) a. The singular endings, -fu, -ar^a, -aiy occur more frequently than in Attic; especially -/u and -cri in the subjunctive, as ISotfU, dydy&lt;afu, iOikya-ty PaXya-i. These endings are rare in the subjunctive of the contracted fu-forms, as &amp;Scri A 129. </p><p>b. In the pluperfect, the older endings -ca ktX. are preserved. The third person singular ends in -c\\xe2\\x82\\xac(v) or -ctv, as Pefii^Keiv A 221,       B 409. </p><p>c. The second and third persons singular of the first aorist optative active end in -cias, -\\xe2\\x82\\xactc( v), as /ytetVcui?, KoXia-etey. The second person in -ais occurs very rarely. The third person in -at is more common, as yrjOi^irajL A 256. The third person plural ends in -cwti/, as riaeuiv A 42, dKoixrciav B 282. </p><p>d. The third person plural optative active of fu-verbs ends in -tcv, as cfcv, Saftctev, Sotev. </p><p>e. The third person plural imperative ends in -rwv, -aOwv (never -Twrav, -trdwrav). </p><p>f. a. Active infinitives (except in the first aorist) frequently end in -/Acmi, which is sometimes shortened after a short vowel to -/xcv, as cfifici/ai, c/i/uteV) cX^\\xe2\\x82\\xac/t\\xe2\\x82\\xacv(&lt;\")&gt; Te$vdfJU\\xc2\\xa3v((a). </p><p>p. The shortening of -/icm to -/icv occurs generally before a vowel, where it may be called elision. </p><p>y. The ending -vai is found only after a long vowel, as Sovvae. </p><p>g. Aorist passive infinitives end in -fuvoL or -vai. </p><p>h. The second person singular of the middle generally remains uncontracted (\\xc2\\xa7 24), as oSvpau, i&amp;rjai T 130, ^SoAXco A 297. Contracted forms are used occasionally, as ficTaTpeirri A 160, yvtaay B 365, k\\xe2\\x82\\xack\\\\i^ T 138. </p><p>i. In the perfect middle, -ooi regularly loses its c. </p><p>j. -ao retains its a only in the imperative, as ^o-&lt;ro, torao-o. k. The first person plural middle often ends in -/ico^ </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"42\" id=\"42\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa747 e. </p><p>THE HOMERIC DIALECT. </p><p>xxxix </p><p>1. The third person plural of the perfect and pluperfect indicative middle often, and of the optative middle always, ends in -aroi, -aro for -vrax, -vro. Before these endings smooth labial and palatal mutes are aspirated, as CTTirerpa^Toi (perfect passive of CTrtrpciro)). </p><p>m. The third person plural indicative of the aorist passive generally ends in -cv instead of -rj(Tav, as rjyepOev A 57, ifxiavOcv A 200, rpd^^ A 251 8i\\xe2\\x82\\xacTfmy\\xe2\\x82\\xacv A 531.   Cf, the active \\xe2\\x82\\xac-Xv-&lt;ra-v, \\xe2\\x82\\xac-Xvo-v. </p><p>n. SimUarly, v is used for the later -&lt;rav in the imperfect and second aorist of ftt-verbs, as $vyuv A 273, ia-rav, arav, IjSav. </p><p>o. For the optative ending of fit-verbs, in -tcv not htjouv, see d above. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 45. Subjunctive Mode. a. The variable vowel (*connecting vowel*) of the subjunctive is generally short in the first aorist, second aorist of /bi^forms, second aorist passive, second perfect of primitive formation, as Prjarofiev, dyupofjuev, to/xcv, ^cto/xcv, rpaweiofuv, Sa/icicrc, ctSo/icv, ireiroiOofJLev. (H. 373D; G. 780.) </p><p>This short vowel is found before the endings -fjtev, -rov, -re, and in middle forms. </p><p>b. A few forms of the first aorist have a long vowel following the analogy of the present, as Snj^rfoyirai T 107. </p><p>c. There are no certain examples of the short mode-vowel in the present of verbs in -&lt;d. (For jSovXcrai dvrcouras A 67, PavKrfr avricura? may be substituted, etc) </p><p>K.B. The forms of the first aorist subjunctive are easily confused with those of the future, with which they are identical in appearance. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 46. Optative Mode, For the optative endings, see 44 c, d, \\xc2\\xa7 47. Contract Verbs. (H. 409 D; G. 784 ff.) a. Verbs in -ao) exhibit unchanged, assimilated, and contracted forms; the poet\\'s choice between contracted and uncontracted forms seems to have been determined largely by the rhythm. The vowels are regularly contracted when the second is in a short syllable. </p><p>b. Uncontracted forms without assimilation occur rarely, as ircivacov r 25.   (ovra, A 525 and often, is a second aorist, see \\xc2\\xa7 53.) </p><p>c. The rowels of the uncontracted forms are generally assimilated, a prevailing over a following \\xe2\\x82\\xac or ij but being assimilated to o, oi, or ov. These forms are intermediate between the original and the contracted stage. </p><p>d. One of the vowels is usually lengthened in the text of the Mss. Sometimes this appears to be a conformation to Attic usage (\\xc2\\xa7 22/). </p><p>e. Verbs in -cai generally remain uncontracted; except cc, which is generally contracted in the Mss., but often the uncontracted forms are </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"43\" id=\"43\"/><p>xl </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7471 </p><p>metrically possible, co is very rarely contracted except in the participle ending -cv/xcvo? (where contraction occurs to prevent a too frequent recurrence of short syllables, \\xc2\\xa7 59 e). co) is never contracted but is often pronounced as one syllable by synizesis (\\xc2\\xa7 25). </p><p>f. Sometimes the variable vowel c is contracted with c of the stem instead of with the termination. One of these vowels is sometimes dropped^ as dirocupco A 275. </p><p>g. The older form of these verbs, in -cko, is sometimes preserved, as crcXctero A 5, veucctiyo-i A 579.   See \\xc2\\xa7 23 e. </p><p>h. ffiop\\xe2\\x82\\xac(o forms ^pcciv A 144, ^op^m B 107. </p><p>i. Verbs in -oa&gt; are generally contracted. Sometimes they have forms with the double o sound, like verbs in -oo), as iarpaTotavro T 187 (which might be written carparooyro). </p><p>\\xc2\\xa748. Tenses. Future and First Aoristy Active and Middle. (H.420ff.; G. 777.) a. Pure verbs which do not lengthen the stem-vowel in the formation of the tenses, often have double a in the future and first aorist, active and middle. </p><p>b. In the future the &lt;r of the before-mentioned verbs often disappears, as KoXiovaa T 383, ^Xctrcu B 325. </p><p>c. Stems in S often show double a in the aorist. </p><p>d. Most of these forms with aa may be explained as original or assimilated, as vciKco-o-c from the theme vcucco- (c/. veiKos), KOfAioxraro for K0fu8aaro (cf. ko/u8i;). Thus the stem-vowel of these verbs was not final originally, and hence is not lengthened in the future and aorist. </p><p>e. Some stems in X and p retain the cr of the future and aorist (as some do in Attic), as HXxrajL A 409, Kvpcras T 23, wpce A 10. </p><p>f. The so-called Doric future with tense-sign o-c, is foimd in iaadrtu B393. </p><p>g. Some verbs have a future without tense-sign, as cTfu, KoxKeiovrei to lie down, cSo/xot, irCofjuUf ipvta. Most of these verbs are old presents which acquired a future signification, elpj, is not always future in Homer, c/*. B. 87. </p><p>h. Some verbs form the first aorist active and middle without a, as Ix^cv Z 419 (from       ^^r ^x^)\\' \\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;\\'\\'0\\'\\xe2\\x82\\xacva E 208, iicrfa A 40 from Ktu&lt;a. </p><p>i. The first aorist often has the variable vowel of the second aorist &lt;&gt;/c, as Ifov, SwcTo. So in the imperative, as jSi/crco E 109, Jpaco F 250, afcrc r 105, oio-crc r 103; infinitive, outc/acvoi F 120; participle, imPrjaoiiaw E46. </p><p>j. Verbs in -{w often have themes in y, and thus futures and first aorists in -(ta and -(a, as cjoAaTro^at A 129, irrokepu^ofjuev B 328. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 49. Perfect. (H. 446 ff., 490; G. 682 ff.) a. The soKsalled first perfeet in -Ka is formed only from 20 vowel-stems.  It is almost as rare as </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"44\" id=\"44\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa762. THE HOMERIC DIALECT. xli </p><p>the first aorist in -#ca (ISwica, hfKo, lOriKo). Forms without k are derived even from vowel-stems, especially participial forms, as KiKfii^Ka^ Z 262, but K\\xe2\\x82\\xacKfnfiTi Z 261. </p><p>b. The final mute of the stem is not aspirated. </p><p>c. The endings are affixed immediately to the reduplicated verb-stem in PePatun, yeyacuras, Scffit^t, iUrrp^, l^fxev, KtKfirfia^, c?rc7ri^ficv, rirXxtBi, </p><p>d. eppCyyai T 353 and 6\\\\&lt;o\\\\rf A 164 have the force of prei^ent subjunctives. </p><p>e. dKaxifi^vo^ and iaavfjuevos are accented irregularly as presents. </p><p>f. The second perfect often has a long vowel in the stem where the second aorist has a short vowel, as opwpcv B 797, wpope B 14G. </p><p>g. In the feminine participle the short form of the stem appears, as afnfpilkf but dpapvia; hence iucvla. not elicvia T 386 etc, </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 50. Voices. Middle, a. The active and middle forms opav (about 40 times) and bpaxrOai (about 20 times), tSctv (more than 200 times) and i^irOax (90 times), are used often without appreciable difference of meaning.   C/. l&lt;#ttTc B 807,      A 584. </p><p>b. The first aorist middle is sometimes used without difference of meaning from the second aorist active, as jSi/crcTo, V 262, l^i; A 311; cSv0-6TO r 328,18v r 36. </p><p>c. The future middle is sometimes used as passive, as rcXcco^ B 36. C/. 51 e. </p><p>d. The aorist middle is often used as passive.

For the ending of the aorist passive infinitive, see \\xc2\\xa7 44 ^. </p><p>b. For the ending of the third person plural indicative, see \\xc2\\xa7 44 w. </p><p>c. The second aorist subjunctive passive usually remains uncontracted, and follows the rule of /u-verbs (\\xc2\\xa7 52 c). </p><p>d. In the second aorist subjunctive, the passive suffix is often long (and the mode 70wel short in the dual and in the first or second person plural, \\xc2\\xa7 45 a), as &amp;if\\xc2\\xbb7i79 T 436 {SdfivYffu), rpaweCofiev T 441 (t^o&gt;, \\xc2\\xa7 31), but pxyiwTiv B 475 (fuay&lt;o), </p><p>e.

For the ending -v for -&lt;rav, see \\xc2\\xa7 44 n. </p><p>o. The second aorist subjunctive active generally remains nncontracted. The stem vowel often appeai-s in its long form with short mode vowel in the dual and in the first and second persons plural (c/. \\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa7 45 a, 51 d), as ^&lt;nv A 324, ^cio/icv A 143 (better Orjofjuev, Attic ^ficv), yviown A 302, iptiofjusv A 62 (better iprjofjueif, as from an iprffu), </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 53. Second Aorists without Variable Vowel. (H. 489; G. 125, 3.) Many second aorists, active and middle, are found without variable vowel, following the analogy of verbs in -/u, as SXro A 532 (oAAofuu), lyvo) A 199, Ukto B 420 (S\\xe2\\x82\\xacxofJim), p\\\\^o A 518 (^c\\xc2\\xa3Ua)), k\\\\v$i A 37, kXvt\\xe2\\x82\\xac B 56 (icXvw), ovra Z 64, \\xe2\\x82\\xac&lt;r(rvTO B 809 (&lt;r\\xe2\\x82\\xacva&gt;). </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 54. Iterative Forms, (H. 493; G. 778.) a. Iterative forms of the imperfect and aorist indicate the repetition of a state or action. The augment is generally omitted. These forms are characterized by the suffix -o-K, and have the inflection of the imperfect of verbs in -o&gt;. They are confined to the Ionic dialect. The iterative idea is frequently waning and occasionally is lost. </p><p>b. Verbs in -co add the endings -o-kov or -a-KOfiriu to the c-form of the stem of the present or second aorist, as co-kc, cittco-kc, iScotkc. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 55. Prepositions, a. Prepositions often retain their original adverbial force (as iv 3c but therein, irapa 8c and beside him). They may be placed after the verbs or nouns with which they are connected. See \\xc2\\xa719 6.   (H. 785; G. 1222ff.) </p><p>b. The preposition is often separated from the verb which it modifies, as Trap 8c Kc&lt;^aAAi7vo)v oft^l ortxcs ovk aXairahval \\\\ earaxrav A 330 f., where vdp modifies corcurav. </p><p>o. Anastrophe, (H. 109; G. 116.) a. Disyllabic prepositions, when they immediately follow the word with which they are construed, take the accent upon the penult, except d/x^i, dvri, dm, 8(d. ova Z 331 stands for dvafTTYfOi.   Ivt is used for Ifvcuri or Ivcori, lirt for Ittcoti, /lera for </p><p>flCTCOTt. </p><p>p. Elided prepositions suffer anastrophe only when they as adverbs modify a verb to be supplied, as or* T 45 for hrtfm, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or by way of exception, in order to avoid ambiguity, as c^* A 350, to show that the preposition is to be connected with the preceding word. </p><p>d. a. cv has the parallel forms ctv, cn. ctv stands only in the part of the foot which receives the ictus, and its use is nearly confined to certain phrases, as civ dyofyg, ctv *Ai8ao Sofjuouriv. </p><p>p. The poet uses both h and ci9, Trpos, irporl, and ttot^ viro and </p><p>VJTOJL. </p><p>f. d/A^t, dvd, and fierd are used also with the dative. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"46\" id=\"46\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa767 d. </p><p>HOMERIC VERSE. </p><p>zliii </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 56. Adverbs. (H.257ff.; G.365ff.) a. A predicate adjective is often used where the English idiom has an adverb or an adverbial phrase, as x^^o^ \\'^Pv ^ yesterday, rjepttf A 497 early in the </p><p>morning, iram^fiepioi. A 472 cdl day long, irprpnj^ E 58 (pronus) on his face, </p><p>irpo^^pm willing is used only predicatively, where the English idiom uses willingly. </p><p>b. Adverbs ending in -a are common: o-a^ rax^ cSko. These seem to have been originally neuter cognate accusatives, and many are such still; cf, TToAA\\' circrcAAc, iroXXa rjparo, fieya vj/ttic, fuyaX evx^ro, ktX. </p><p>o. Adverbs in -m are not common; they are most frequent from o-stems: ovrois (ouro9)\\xc2\\xbb (Ss (o), avrois (avrds), kokqis (kokos). lo-cus and 6fu&gt;io&gt;9 are not found, KoXm only p 63, ^iXcus only A 347. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa757. HOMERIC VERSE. The Heroic Hexameter, (H. 1064 ff., 1100; G. 1668 f.) a. The poems are to be read with careful attention to the metrical quantity of each syllable, as well as to the sense of the passage. There are six feet (bars or measures) in each verse; hence the name hexameter. Emphasis or stress of voice is laid on the first syllable of each foot. The part of the foot which has no ictus (the arsis) should receive as much time though not so much stress as the ictus-syllable (the thesis). The rhythm would be called } time in modern music. The English hexameter (found e.g, in Longfellow\\'s Evangeline) is generally read as of | time. </p><p>b. The written word-accent is to be disregarded in reading Homeric verse. Occasionally the verse-ictus and word-accent may coincide, but the word-accent seems to have had no influence on the formation of the verse. </p><p>o. The dactyl (J ^^or_ww), with the ictus on the first syllable, is the fundamental and prevailing foot of Homeric verse. It is often replaced by a spondee^ or heavy dactyl (J  J or ). </p><p>Dactyls are about three times as frequent as spondees in the Homeric poems. </p><p>d. Verses in which each of the first five feet is a dactyl are far more common in Homer than in Vergil: there are 160 in the first book of the Iliad alone. Many frequently recurring verses have this rhythm; as rov ^ a/nufuipofuvoi vpoo\\'iKlyrf iro&amp;as cofcv? *A)(iXX\\xe2\\x82\\xacik, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 avrap ciret iroaio^ Kal iSvjTvoq ii Ipov crro. Many other verses have but one spondee (generally in the first foot) among the first five feet; as ^/xos 8* 171X10$ icarcSv Kxa ciri </p><p>^ This name was derived from the use of this slow, solemn measure in the hymns which accompanied the libation (jintovl4i) to the gods. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"47\" id=\"47\"/><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa767 e. </p><p>e. Spondees are most common in the first two feet; they are more and more avoided in each foot toward the close of the verse. </p><p>f. The first foot allows more freedom than any other. A short vowel there more frequently retains its natural quantity before a mute and a liquid, and yet la more frequently lengthened in the unaccented part of the foot before that combination. At the close of the first foot, hiatus is allowed (\\xc2\\xa7 27 6). </p><p>g. The Bucolic diaeresis (\\xc2\\xa7 58 h) is seldom immediately preceded by a word of three long syllables. Before this diaeresis, a dactyl is strongly preferred. </p><p>h. Verses which have a spondee in the fifth foot are called spondaic verses (cm; airaySeuucd). They are more common in Homer than in the Latin poets,\\xe2\\x80\\x94about iper cent of the verses of the Iliad being spondaic. </p><p>i. These spondaic verses seem especially frequent at the close of emphatic sentences or of divisions of the narrative (cf, A 21, 157, 291, 600) and in descriptions of suffering and toil, but often no rhythmic effect is sought; the convenience of the verse determined the measure. </p><p>j. The last foot in each verse is a spondee, but the final syllable may be short; the deficiency in time is then made up by the slight pause which follows at the end of the verse (\\xc2\\xa7 59 a, /). A heavy or consonantal ending is preferred; hence the v-movable is often used. </p><p>k. The student need not concern himself about elision as in Latin poetry; that is already done in the text; but he must be watchful for synizesis (\\xc2\\xa7 25). </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 58. Caesural Pauses. (H. 1081; G. 1642.) a. Each verse has one or more caesural pauses (caesura = to/lliJ cutting)^ \\xe2\\x80\\x94 pauses within a foot. </p><p>b. The principal caesura of the verse is always a pause in the sense, and is often emphasized by punctuation, but occasionally commas are found where no pause is necessary. </p><p>Of course no pause can be made immediately before an enclitic, since this is closely connected with the foregoing word. </p><p>o. A caesura is almost always found in the third foot; only 185 verses of the Iliad and 71 of the Odyssey have no pause there. It occurs either after the ictusnsyllable (as fjojviv aciSc Ota A niyXi/ta&amp;o) \\'A;(iX^o5 A 1 </p><p>v/vl \\xe2\\x80\\x94 A \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 vv/l l)&gt;or between the </p><p>two short syllables (as av8pa fwi cwcttc Movora A iroAvrpoirov os fm\\\\a </p><p>iroXXa al, \\\\       w l_-*^A*^|_-vvy| \\xe2\\x80\\x94 v/wl !)\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 These </p><p>two caesuras are about equally frequent; but the second slightly predominates and seems to have been preferred. </p><p>d. The importance of the caesura in the third foot is marked not only by the freedom with which hiatus is allowed there (\\xc2\\xa7 27 b), and by </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"48\" id=\"48\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa758k. </p><p>HOMERIC VERSE. </p><p>xlv </p><p>the evident avoidance of elision at that point, but also by the large number of tags of verses which are suited to follow it; as irarrjp avSpStv T\\xe2\\x82\\xac OeStv TC, PoSnri^ irorvta \"^pvf, $\\xe2\\x82\\xaca XcvkcoAcws \"H/m;, ^ca yAavKowrt? \\'Aftyny, &lt;l&gt;i\\\\ofifij\\xe2\\x82\\xaci8rf^ \\'A^po&amp;Ti;, Ato9 Ovydrrjp \\'A^po&amp;riy, evicn^/titScs \\'A^auK, *A)(ajMv )(aXKO)(iriavii}v, Koprq KO/xoovrcs \\'Ayajuoi^ apiffL&lt;l&gt;iXoi McveAoos, dva^ OLvSplav *Ayafi\\xe2\\x82\\xac/Ltvo)v, P&lt;njv dyajSb^ /Siio/irjSvj^, TtpijvuK Unrora Ncorcop ktX. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all of which must be preceded by the feminine caesura (see /) of the third foot; while \\'Aya/jic/tivoi/os ^ArpeiBou}, evpv Kputov \\'Aya/Ltc/tivcDv, ijyijTop\\xe2\\x82\\xac9 ftcSoKTCs, aTraftci^CTo ^vivtj(T\\xe2\\x82\\xacv TC ktX. must be preceded by the masculine caesura of the third foot.  See \\xc2\\xa7 22 c. </p><p>e. The pause after the first syllable of the third foot is called the penthemimeral caesura (ircvrc, ijfu-, ficpos) because it comes after the fifth half-foot; it divides the verse into 2 J + 3 J feet. The pause between the two short syllables of the third foot divides the verse into 2| + 3} feet. </p><p>f. The pause after an ictus-syllable is called a masculine caesura because of the vigorous movement which it gives to the verse. The pause between two unaccented syllables is called a feminine caesura. </p><p>g. Sometimes the principal pause of the verse is the masculine caesura of the fourth foot. This is called the hephthemimeral caesura (eirra, tipx-, fUpoi), It is frequent after a feminine caesura of the third foot. It gives an energetic movement after a penthemimeral caesura, when the verse is divided into 2i + 1 + 2} feet. </p><p>h. Sometimes the pause of the verse is at the close of the fourth foot; this is called the Bucolic diaeresis (a diaeresis being a pause at the end of a word between two feet) or caesura, since it is most evidently aimed at in the bucolic or pastoral poetry of Theocritus. Occasionally there is a transition at this point to another part of the story, as A 318, 348, 430. This Bucolic diaeresis with the penthemimeral caesura divides the verse into 2i + l} + 2feet. </p><p>i. The importance of the Bucolic diaeresis is marked by the large number of tags of verses which are ready to follow it, as Stb? \\'08v&lt;r&lt;rcv5, IpKOi \\'A)(ajuov, imrora Ncorw/a, o^pifios \"Aprf^y ^xuSifjm ^EKTtap, $01^09 \\'AirdAAcDv, IlaAAas \\'AOT^vrf, ^ Ocdiav, firfrUra Zcv9\\xc2\\xbb uroBw ^ciis. See \\xc2\\xa7 22 c.  Hiatus is allowed here occasionally.   See \\xc2\\xa7 27 h, </p><p>j. A slight pause occurs about as often, after the first short syllable of the fifth foot.  The poet prefers to close the verse with the rhythm </p><p>\\\\jy \\\\j (where the comma represents the end of a word) rather </p><p>than  ; hence ovrc reA.eo-(ras A 108, not aSr\\' cTcXcororas, and </p><p>dXy\\xe2\\x82\\xac tOrjKev A 2, not oXyea $rjK\\xe2\\x82\\xacv. </p><p>k. The principal pause of the verse is seldom found at the close of the third foot.  This would divide the verse into two equal parts and </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"49\" id=\"49\"/><p>xlyi </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7581. </p><p>cause monotony. A word ends there not infrequently, but is accompanied by a more prominent caesura in the third or fourth foot; as evBa i3oK irXciOTouf ^pvyaq avcpas T 185, where the last two words are so closely connected that no caesura is felt between them. </p><p>L Even a slight pause is rare between the two short syllables of the fourth foot. In jcot iirttBero /ivO^ A 33, the objectionable pause might be avoided by omitting the augment, but the conjunction is connected with the verb so closely that no caesm*a is felt. </p><p>m. No sentence ends with the second foot. </p><p>n. The pause in the third foot gives to the rest of the verse an anapaestic movement, from which it is often recalled by the Bucolic diaeresis. </p><p>o. The varied position of the main caesura, and the minor pauses in different parts of the verse, give perfect freedom from monotony without detracting from the grace and dignity of the measure. </p><p>\\xc2\\xa7 59. QuANTiTY.i (H. 92 ff.; G. 98 ff., 1622.) a. Metrical convenience or necessity often determined the poet\\'s choice among synonymous words (\\xc2\\xa7 22 a-c). The poet in general preferred the light dactyls to the heavy dactyls or spondees, and retained in the \\xc2\\xa3pic dialect a large number of dactylic forms which were aftei*wards contracted.   An amphi</p><p>macer (_ v/ , d/x^i, fuucpov) was avoided often by means of apocope, </p><p>synizesis, or elision. </p><p>Most exceptions to the rules of quantity are only apparent. The poet, for example, did not lengthen a short syllable by placing the ictus upon it. If an apparently short final syllable stands where a long syllable is expected, it is probable either </p><p>(1) that the final syllable was originally long, and later lost part of its quantity; or </p><p>^ The beginner will find it convenient to remember concerning a, i, u, the vowels whose quantity is not clear at the first glance, that </p><p>(1) they are short in the final syllable of any word when the antepenult has the acute or if the penult has the circumflex accent; </p><p>(2) they are regularly short in infiectional endings, as ixdxv^^* ^ptaa^ rpfwown, rdBtmiKa,\\xe2\\x80\\x94in the final syllables of neuter nouns, as 8\\xc2\\xa3/\\xc2\\xaba, ^fiap, fi\\xe2\\x82\\xac\\\\i, ddnpv,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 in suffixes, except where v has been lost before o-, as (f&gt;^aU, 8oMi}s, ^olyiaaa, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in particles, especially in prepositions, as iiyd, irepi, ^6, apa, in, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and generally in the second aorist stem of verbs; </p><p>(3) they are long in the final syllable when the penult is long by nature and has the acute accent; </p><p>(4) they are long when they are the result of contraction, as irlfM from irifjuLt, ip6v, from Up6v, and as the final vowel of the stem of nouns of the first declension. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"50\" id=\"50\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa759e. </p><p>HOMERIC VERSE. </p><p>xlvii </p><p>(2) that the following word has lost an initial consonant which would have made the preceding syllable long by position (see j below); or </p><p>(3) that the pause (musical rest) of a caesura or diaeresis, fills out the time occupied by the foot, allowing the same freedom as at the end of the verse (\\xc2\\xa7 57 j), </p><p>b. A considerable number of anomalies, however, remain unexplained. Prominent among the unexplained anomalies of quantity is the I of certain abstract nouns, which form such a definite class that it may be assumed that there was some explanation, perhaps physiological, for them all. </p><p>c. Many apparently irregular variations of natural quantity, as well as apparent freedom in allowing hiatus, and variations of quantity made by position (see j below), are to be explained by the loss of a consonant, e.g. -AiSos T 322 but \\xc2\\xabAt8t A 3, from a-fiS (\\xc2\\xa7 32), fji\\xe2\\x82\\xacfjLa&lt;rav B 863 but fUfidorts B 818 (ftc/ia/rore?)* </p><p>d. a. A syllable which contains a long vowel or a diphthong is long by nature. Final cu and oi are metrically long, although short as regards accentuation. </p><p>p. The quantity of some vowels is not fixed, as ^AttoWqivo? A 14, AAiroXXcDv, A 380; \\'Ape?, \"Api^ E 31 (if the text is right). </p><p>y. Most of these vowels with variable quantity were originally long and were becoming short, as the Homeric lo-os, icaXos, and ^apos, became loros, icaXo9&gt; and &lt;f&gt;dpoi in Attic poetry, fuapivo (cf, ^pvj euxpivif B 471), Attic iapivosi is found on a Boeotian inscription. Evidently every vowel which at first was long and afterwards became short must have had at some time a metrical quantity which could be treated either as long or short, ue. its quantity was variable. </p><p>8. For the length of final i in the dative singular of the third declension, see \\xc2\\xa7 36 a. wpCv in vpiv avr Z 81 retains its original length, as a contracted comparative. </p><p>\\xe2\\x82\\xac. With this variation of natural quantity may be compared the double forms employed in Homer, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one with a single consonant, another with two consonants, as \\'Ax^AXcvs A 54,\\'AxtXev\\'s A 199; \\'OSvoro-cvs A 430, \\'OSwcvs A 494; TpiKKrfv B 729, TpU-qs A 202; ottttcus A 344, &amp;jrm A 136; pjsxraoif r 266, /ico-ov A 481, KT^, many of which doubled consonants are known to be justified etyraologically. </p><p>e. Sometimes a naturally short vowel was lengthened (not by the poet, but in the speech of the people) in order to avoid the too frequent recurrence of short syllables. This is illustrated by the rule for the use of o or 0) in the comparison of adjectives ((ro^a&gt;repo9 but Kov&lt;^or\\xe2\\x82\\xacpos), and by the words which have a vowel similarly lengthened in the Attic * </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"51\" id=\"51\"/><p>xlviii </p><p>INTRODUCTION. </p><p>S59\\xc2\\xa3 </p><p>dialect (as iOavaroi, trfKunf^fopo^^ \\\\nrrfpmj9)\\xc2\\xbb We find Sin^p but av^?, UpXafws but JlpiofuSvii, $vyarrfp but Ovydrepau </p><p>f. a. In Homeric verse a syllable which contains a short vowel is long by position when the vowel is followed by a double consonant ^, if/) or by two or more consonants, whether these are in the same or in the following word or are divided between the two words. </p><p>p. This rule holds good also in case of a mute followed by a liquid. This combination rarely fails to make position within a word, and generally makes position when it stands at the beginning of a word, especially when this word is closely connected with the preceding. </p><p>g. a. Sometimes a vowel remains short before a mute followed by X or as ^A&lt;l&gt;po&amp;iTrf T 380, &amp;p,4&gt;XPpanji B 389, &amp;fx&lt;l&gt;XSpv&lt;li^ B 700, Trp&amp;rpair&amp;r$ai Z 336, vcvore KpoviW A 528, jSaXe Upea/uSao F 356, yap pa KAvraipvqarpvfi A 113. These words and phrases could not have been brought into the verse if the mute and liquid must make length by position, and the history of the language shows that this combination of mute and liquid was gradually losing its weight. </p><p>p. That a mute and liquid do not always make length by position is explained by the ease with which the combination can be pronounced at the beginning of a syllable, leaving the preceding vowel short. </p><p>y. Before four words, two of which begin with the double consonant { and two with the two consonants o-jc (not a mute and a liquid), the preceding vowel remains short: oi re ZokwOov B 634, oi 8c ZeXciav B 824) irpoxtovTo ^KapdvSptov B 465, iTreira a-Keirapvoy c 237. </p><p>h. a. A single X, /a, v, p, &lt;r, at the beginning of certain words, may make position (cf. \\xc2\\xa7 30 : lirea vi&lt;^a8carari T 222 (cf, dya-m&lt;^ A 420 and English snow), </p><p>p. So also 8 makes position in the stem Bpi- (8curai fear), and always In Siyv long, as iBciaev ^ 6 ycpw A 33, ov ti pkXa Sijv A 416. </p><p>i. a. Cognate languages and collateral dialectic forms show that most words which in the Attic dialect began with p, once began with a-p or pp. This explains the doubling of the p after the augment and in composition, as well as its power to make position in Homeric verse. </p><p>p. Of the instances of lengthening before p, most are only physiologically explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the prsoimd being easily continued until it is virtually a double consonant. But this lengthening occurs only before certain stems, not before iia\\\\\\xe2\\x82\\xacodax, pmtv, poGvos ktX. </p><p>j. One of the consonants which made position has often been lost, as ypiyt hi fuv puKvta V 386, ^cXos cxcitcvkcs A 51, $w ws T 230 (for pilk), cf. Kojcov (OS B 190, opvi^es cSs T 2, ireXcKvs &lt;I&gt;s F 60, oi 8* 3p\\' ta-av c5$ crrcB780. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"52\" id=\"52\"/><p>\\xc2\\xa7 69 m. </p><p>HOMERIC VERSE. </p><p>xlix </p><p>k. a. A long final vowel or diphthong in the arsis of the foot is regularly shortened before a following vowel: \\'ArpciStu re koI SXXoi ivicviffu&amp;s *A;(tuoi A 17, rtfv ^ cyw ov Avcro) A 29. The shortening of a long vowel is essentially the elision of half the vowel (\\xc2\\xa7 27 &lt;/). </p><p>fi. Final ou, oc, a are most frequently shortened before an initial vowel. Final oc is shortened eight times as often as final 17. </p><p>y. The diphthongs with v seem to have been more firm in retaining their quantity than those with i. </p><p>8. This shortening of diphthongs seems to indicate a tendency of the final I or V of the diphthong to go into its cognate y {J} or w (p) sound and disappear (cf, \\xc2\\xa7 23/). In Pindar, also, a final diphthong is shortened five times as often as a long final vowel. Of course there was no hiatus as long as the j or p was spokeo. </p><p>c. Final ^ and are shortened before an initial vowel more rarely than other diphthongs. &lt;^ is seldom shortened except before an e or (less frequently) an a. </p><p>1. Before a pause (as before the close of the verse, see \\xc2\\xa7 57 j), a short vowel may be used in place of a long vowel: iiaripaax Upidfwio voXxv </p><p>A 19 \\\\       Kj I^A.   Not infrequently thus the short final </p><p>vowel of a vocative takes the place of a long syllable, even co vie IIcreaM) A 338; in such cases the nominative form frequently could be used. The pause in the rhythm occupies the remainder of the time which would be spent in pronouncing a long syllable, J = J Before a pause, also, a long final vowel may preserve its quantity although the following word begins with a vowel. </p><p>m. A few verses seem to begin with a short syllable, as 09 ^817 ra r ioirra A 70 (for Ss \\xc2\\xa7 32). </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"53\" id=\"53\"/><p>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE. </p><p>The Homeric Mss. are better and more ancient than those of any other secular Greek author. In all, more than one hundred are known and described. The most valuable for the Homeric text, and far the most valuable for the old Greek Commentary (2x&lt;&gt;^)&gt; ^ known as Venetus in the library of San Marco at Venice. It contains the entire Iliad, with Introduction and Scholia, on 325 leaves of parchment in large folio, 15x11 inches. It was written not later than the eleventh century of our era. </p><p>The earliest printed edition of Homer was that of Demetrius Chalcondylas, in two large and handsome volumes, Florence, 1488. </p><p>The most important critical editions of the Iliad, are those of Bekker (1858), La Roche (1873), Nauck (1877), Christ (1884). </p><p>Convenient text editions are those of Dindorf-Hentze (Leipzig, 1884) and Cauer (Leipzig, 1890). </p><p>The most scholarly English edition of the entire Iliad, is as yet that of Leaf, in two volumes, London, 1886, 1888. </p><p>The most convenient small work treating of (a) the general literary characteristics of the poems, (li) the Homeric world, (c) Homer in antiquity, (d) the Homeric question, is Homer; An Introduction to the Iliad and the Odyssey by Professor Jebb, Boston, 1887. </p><p>Homer, a * literature primer,\\' by Gladstone, New York, 1878, will be suggestive and helpful to many, although it is not to be compared with Professor Jebb\\'s work. </p><p>The * Homeric question\\' is clearly stated in The Origin of the Homeric Poems, by Bonitz, translated by Professor Packard, New York, 1880. </p><p>Matthew Arnold\\'s Essay On translating Homer, in Essays in Criticism, makes distinct the most prominent characteristics of Homeric style. </p><p>Monro\\'s Grammar of the Homeric Dialect, Oxford, 1891, is by far the best work on the subject in the English language. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"55\" id=\"55\"/><p>JjUm4^    /      :,u:CJi^    /AjL^~:y^ .yt^iycX^ </p><p>) </p><p>OMHPOT lAIAAOS A. </p><p>^\\'AX^a        Xpierov, \\\\otfihtf arparov, ^x^^\\' ftydtermp.

Prooemium: The wrath of Achilles, from its very heginningy and the destructive consequences which followed in accordance with the will of Zeus, This is the principal theme of the Iliad, The First Book serves as an introduction to the whole poem. It narrates the story of the strife between Achilles and Agamemnon, and the decree of Zeus, which is made on the intercession of Thetis. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 The events narrated in A occupy 21 days. See \\xc2\\xa77 a. </p><p>1. |&amp;i|viv: wrath, lasting anger, the memorem iram of Verg. Aen. i. 4. Cf 81, 247, 488. This receives prominence as being most important for the subject of the poem. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 The definite article is \"\"ot needed in early Greek. The connection decides, as it does in Latin, whether it should be used in translation. See \\xc2\\xa7 42 g. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 0cd: i.e. the Muse. Homer does not assign special names and offices to different muses. See on B 484.

Homer often drops one of two doubled consonants.   See \\xc2\\xa7 59 rf </p><p>2. oiXo|Uvi|v: destructive, deadly, cf Milton Par. Lost i. 2, * forbidden fruit. .. whose mortal taste | Brought death into the world.\\' This is put in a kind of apposition with fiffviv, as if it were an afterthought. The idea is amplified in the following relative clause, cf 10, B 227; see \\xc2\\xa7 12 e. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 |ivp^: countless; not a numeral in Homer. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 For the * elision\\' of a, see \\xc2\\xa7 28 a. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 For the * hiatus,* allowed when the final vowel has been elided, see \\xc2\\xa7 27 g. \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'AxaioCs: often used for all the Greeks, see \\xc2\\xa7 5 a. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 aX-yfa [aXyrf]: i.e. the defeats caused by the absence of Achilles from the conflict. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 For the uncontracted form, see \\xc2\\xa7 24. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 c0t|kcv: caused (as T 321, see \\xc2\\xa7 17), nearly equiv. to rc^xc below, or to the Attic itroCrfo-ci/, </p><p>3. iroXXAs: the second clause of the relative sentence is closely connected with the first, since iroXXas repeats the idea of fivpui, while the third clause is added in the form of a contrast, avrovs ktX, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 l^OCftovs [Attic Kpartpds\\'] : the feminine form i&lt;l&gt;OLfm^ is used by Homer only of persons.

The Catalogue seems to have been prepared for an account of the mustering of the Greeks at Aulis and the embarkation thence (cf, 509 f.), and to have been inserted here with divers alterations. We expect here an account of the forces, not of the ships. </p><p>The nations, their leaders, and the number of their ships are enu\\xc2\\xab merated in a definite geographical order, in three principal divisions: I. (a) The main land of Greece south of Thermopylae; (6) middle and southern Greece with the islands immediately adjoining. 16 contingents. (494-644.) II. Insular Greece, from Crete to Calydnae. 4 contingents. (645-680.) m. Thessalian Greece, from Mts. Oeta and Othrys on the south, to Olympus on the north. 9 contingents. (681-759.) See p. vii. of the Vocabulary. </p><p>The Achaean ships number in all 1186. The number of men on each ship is stated for only two contingents: each Boeotian ship carried 120 men (510); each of the ships of Philoctetes brought 50 men (719). The ships of Achilles also brought each 50 men (11170). From the average of the two numbers given for the Boeotians and the ships of Philoctetes, the ancients reckoned the whole number of Achaeans before Troy as about 100,000. Others reckoned the ships roundly as 1200, assigned 100 men to each ship, and thus estimated the whole number of Achaeans as 120,000. </p><p>The Greeks valued this list highly, because of its geographical and statistical information. They looked upon it as a part of history, a versified geography and gazetteer. They appealed to it to settle disputed questions, and the charge of interpolating verses in it was like a charge of falsifying public records. </p><p>The poet evidently desires to represent this expedition as a great national undertaking. He enumerates even those nations which from their inland position were not likely to have had anything to do with such a war, e,g, the Arcadians (603-614), who are not mentioned in the rest of the Iliad as taking part in the battles on the plain of Troy. The poet does not seem to exalt one nation at the expense of another, either here or in the other parts of the Iliad, A bard wandering from country to country would acquire a wealth of geographical information, but would form no strong local attachments. </p><p>\\'EAAas and the \\'EAXtvcs in this Catalogue are restricted to a part of Thessaly, 683 f. The Dorians and lonians are not mentioned. No Greek colonies are known, whether in Asia Minor, in Sicily and the West, or elsewhere.  The names Peloponnesus, Attica, Eleusis, Megara, Delphi, </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"206\" id=\"206\"/><p>85 </p><p>Olympia, and Pisa, do not appear. Thus this Catalogue seems to have been composed before the Dorian migration into Peloponnesus, and the sending forth of colonies to Asia Minor and the West. </p><p>494-644.   I. Greece south of Thermopylae, with the adjoining islands, </p><p>494-558. Boeotia, Phocis, Locris, Euboea, Athens, Salamis, The enumeration proceeds from Boeotia in a northerly direction, then to the east, then southward, and so to the west, around Boeotia. Seven contingents; 262 ships.   See p. viii. of the Vocabulary. </p><p>The poet begins with Boeotia, prob. because the fleet collected at Aulis (303). Because of this beginning, the ancients gave the name BoKoria or Bouorcoi to the Catalogue of the ships. </p><p>494^10. Boeotia, This document presents a distribution of the Greeks such as existed after the Trojan war. Acc. to Thuc. i. 12, the Boeotians lived in Thessaly until sixty years after the fall of Troy. See on 507. More towns are mentioned in Boeotia than elsewhere. This last fact may indicate not a Boeotian poet, but the extent of the culture and history of the country.

The maker has endeavored to be concise,\\xe2\\x80\\x94to give nothing but what is important for the accurate and appreciative reading of the poem, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and yet to show the original and derived meanings of the words, and to suggest translations which should be both simple and dignified. Much space has been saved by omitting the words and forms which are not found in the first six books of the Iliad. </p><p>A concise special vocabulary to the Homeric Poems, or to parts of them, is open to far fewer objections than a similar vocabulary to any other work of Greek literature, since the words are found more nearly in their original significations and constructions. Ko attempt has been made in this work to tell the history of each word in pre-Hellenic and post-Homeric times. Even the most complete Homeric dictionary cannot entirely supersede the large general lexicons, but a confident hope is felt that the concise form of this vocabulary will save much time for the beginner in Homer. The beginner meets many unusual words. Whether he uses a large or a small dictionary, he will be satisfied, in most cases, with learning the meaning and construction of the new word; and generally this is enough for him. The teachers who insist on the use of the unabridged lexicon of Liddell and Scott by elementary classes in Homer forget the word of Hesiod, ovS* IxraxTiv oa-i^ irXiov yfuxrv iravros, while this vocabulary will give fuller and better information about Homeric words and forms than the abridged edition of Liddell and Scott\\'s lexicon.

Mr. W.

For Introduetloii, $1.00. </p><p>^HE book is in two parts, Syntax of Verbs and Syntax ot w Nouns, with a brief introduction on Arrangement, and the Uses of Prepositions, Conjunctions, and Particles. It is designed for preparatory schools and for early courses in college. </p><p>After the example of recent German works, the exercises are a series of episodes following the narrative of Xenophon\\'s Anabasis through the seven books, to which are added similar exercises based on passages from six books of the Hellenica. The exercises are not translations from the text, but the text furnishes the theme and most of the words and phrases, to which, however, other words or expressions belonging to Xenophon\\'s diction are added. </p><p>The book offers thus a somewhat wide range in its subject-matter and vocabulary, while preserving unity in both, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 based as it is, upon the acknowledged standard of Attic prose. </p><p>A feature of the work is a copious English-Greek vocabulary in which the accompanying constructions are in most cases indicated. It is believed that this will do much to promote accuracy, save time, and facilitate labor on the part of the student. </p><p>A grammar lesson on the chief constructions to be used is prefixed to each exercise, and other grammar references are given in the notes and the vocabulary. </p><p>For those who desire a shorter course, twenty lessons are indicated which include all the regular constructions of Verbs and Nouns. The book is designed, however, to furnish material by which the teacher can extend and vary his course according to special aims and needs. Full indexes of the subject-matter and of the syntactical constructions presented are provided. The sentences, while avoiding involved and difficult constructions, are yet long enough to admit of some attention to connection, symmetry, and other elements of style. </p><p>In brief, the special features offered are : </p><p>(1) A comprehensive scheme of grammatical study ; </p><p>(2) Variety and unity in the subject-matter of the exercises ; </p><p>(3) A copious English-Greek vocabulary. </p><p>aiNN a COMPANY, Publisher, </p><p>Boitoa, New York, and Chicago. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"379\" id=\"379\"/><p>ANABASIS An illustrated Dictionary to Xenophon\\'t </p><p>_ A T^%7 Anabasis, with Groups of words </p><p>Die riON AKY etymologically r\\xc2\\xabUted. </p><p>By </p><p>JOHN WILLIAMS WHITE, Professor of Greek, and MORRIS H.

Cloth. sg3+62 pag^es. lUuttrated. For introductioB, $1.95. </p><p>The lessons in this book have been graded with great care. Each new lesson is built upon the preceding lessons. The author has aimed at a systematic development of the subject, following an even and regular gradation from the simpler to the more difficult and complex lessons. Each lesson consists, by the rule, of a statement of grammatical principles, a vocabulary, exercises, and reading lesson. The principle has been to give only such fundamental facts of grammar as the student must know before he can begin to read the connected narrative of Xenophon intelligently and with pleasure. </p><p>The average number of words in each lesson is only ten. Only those words have been given which are really important. By the rule they are words that occur frequently in the first eight chapters of the Anabasis, or words that occur eight times or more in the whole of the Anabasis. All the information about the word that the pupil needs at this stage of his progress is given in the special vocabulary. </p><p>A set of brief rules of syntax with illustrative examples is given, to which references are made in the body of the book. </p><p>Only those principles of syntax are developed which are so peculiar to Greek as to be really difficult. In the body of the book no stress is laid on the development of the syntax of any other part of speech than that of the verb. In the general vocabularies the aim is to give full information. Particular attention is called to the Greek-English vocabulary. </p><p>The book is very fully illustrated, but not primarily for the sake of embellishment. A great deal of study was devoted to this part of the work. The pictures are constantly referred to in the vocabularies. These have been selected from the best sources. </p><p>B. L.

Half morocco. Ixv + 478 +194 pages. Illustrated. For introduction, $1.40. </p><p>This new edition of Cicero has been treated with special reference to the use of the orations as models of classic oratory. The Introduction is made to help in this study of applied logic and rhetoric. There is a full life of Cicero, describing his education and development as an orator, as well as his political career. There is a chapter connecting the style of the orations with ancient formal rhetoric. There is also a chapter on Roman oratory and the place of the orator in ancient civilization. </p><p>The text includes the following orations: The Manilian Law, four orations against Catiline, Archias, Milo, Marcellus, Ligarius, the fourteenth Philippic, and copious extracts from the Defence of Roscius and the Actio Secunda against Verres. </p><p>Almost everything admitting of graphic presentation has an illustration, and no little study has been expended in finding the most suitable pictures. Views of places, scenes of Roman life, and portraits have been specially sought. Many coins are shown. The illustrations are fully explained in the Index, with criticisms. </p><p>J. H. Weetcott, Professor of Latin, Princeton University^ Princeton^ N.J.: I shall recommend the use of it in the Princeton Preparatory School. </p><p>Prank Smalley, Professor of Latin, Syracuse University ^ Syracuse, N.

A special aim of the introduction and notes is to introduce the student to a literary study of Virgil and so open the way to a fruitful reading of the classic authors generally. The learner is skilfully introduced to scansion. Full information and practical directions are given, and, in particular, English prosody is made the gate to Latin prosody. </p><p>The notes have been faithfully revised. The grammatical references have been made to fit the latest editions of the grammars. </p><p>A special feature of the notes is the attempt to illustrate by quotations from a wide range of English poets. Virgil, thus studied, should become a most valuable aid in the general literary culture of the pupil. </p><p>Close and discriminating care has been given to the illustrations. Facsimile reproduction has been largely employed in this edition as the only satisfactory process. Fine engravings on wood have been presented where the subject allowed, and the pictures as a whole are believed to possess remarkable power and beauty as well as illustrative value. </p><p>B. P. Crowell, Professor of Latin, A ntherst College, A mhersty Mass.: Worthy of being heartily commended to every teacher and student of Virgil. </p><p>W. B.

The book contains connected passages based on each chapter of the first four books of Caesar, and on six orations of Cicero; there are also supplementary exercises for sight tests. </p><p>While the words, idioms, and constructions required in translating into Latin may all be found in the text, the author has avoided the mistake of merely putting together parts of different sentences, taken from the text unchanged, which the pupil may hunt up and put together without knowing the construction of the sentence. </p><p>The exercises have been carefully constructed so as to preserve the narrative, style, and spirit of the original. The utmost care has been taken to lead the pupil to observe, appreciate, and use the proper con^ junctions and pronouns which mark the transitions from one sentence to another in Latin. </p><p>It has been the constant aim of the author to lead the pupil to acquire a working knowledge of grammar, so that he may rely more upon himself and less upon the teacher. Instead of telling the pupil, for instance, whether to use the subjunctive or infinitive, reference has been made to the grammar to the principle involved, so that the pupil learns his grammar as he needs it, and applies it as he learns it. </p><p>The plan has been adopted of giving numerous cross-references, to foster the habit of comparing various passages in which a given construction, or idiom, occurs, \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a practice invaluable to the student at every stage df his progress. </p><p>GINN &amp; COMPANY, Publishers, Boston, New York, and Chicaio. </p><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"385\" id=\"385\"/><p>THE FIRST LATIN BOOK </p><p>By W.

This has always been regarded as the truest and soundest of Latin grammar manuals. Instead of making arbitrary laws and distinctions in order to secure an artificial clearness of statement, this grammar has been faithful to the spirit and the facts of the language. This is its fundamental excellence. The grammar explains the language instead of trying to make the language bear out the grammar. </p><p>Second. The present edition is as strong in class-room availability as it is for linguistic truth. George L. Kittredge, Professor of English at Harvard, was associate reviser, and largely on account of his combining special qualifications in Latin and in English, the style of the grammar was radically improved. It is believed to be now much clearer, more crisp and definite, more interesting and leamable, than any other grammar. </p><p>Third. Even in all the little points, the closest care was taken in the revision, and scarcely a book can be found in which the excellence is so uniform and in which the finish reaches so faithfully to the minutest details. </p><p>Fourth.

Worsley, MM.A. Oxon., Classical Masters in Edinburgh Academy. </p><p>This Atlas also contains Allen\\'s Geography of the Ancient World, which is designed to bring the leading epochs and events of ancient history into connection with the geography of the ancient world. Brief suggestions to teachers are added, to assist in the work of the class-room. </p><p>Spectator: It has the special attraction of Mr. Gladstone\\'s cooperation, who not only placed at the editor\\'s disposal the illustrations to his work on Homer, but enhanced the favor by revising the proof-sheets of the plates and text, as adapted for this Atlas. </p><p>Tracy Peck, Professor of Latin, Yale University: I have heretofore known the Atlas sufficiently well to feel justified in recommending it to inquiring students. </p><p>W. W. Goodwin, Professor of Greek, Harvard University: It is a most beautiful and highly useful work, and I am glad to see what used to be an expensive luxury brought within the means of all students of the classics. </p><p>S. R. Win&amp;ns, Professor of Greek, College of New fersey: It is superb: nothing to criticise, and everything to commend. Every student of the classics needs something of the sort, and this is by all odds the best of its kind. </p><p>QINN &amp; COMPANY, Publishers, </p><p>Boston. New York. Chicago. Atlanta.
